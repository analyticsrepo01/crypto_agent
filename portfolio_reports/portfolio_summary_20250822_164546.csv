The MACD confirms this bearish sentiment with a negative histogram (-5.729) and a bearish crossover (MACD Line 0.160 is below the Signal Line 5.888). The AI trend analysis explicitly identifies a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence and HIGH risk, reasoning that ""Price is trading below all key moving averages, the MACD shows a bearish crossover with a negative histogram, and negative price movement is confirmed by high volume."" Current volume is exceptionally high (30518966.50x average), which strongly confirms the conviction behind this bearish price action.
