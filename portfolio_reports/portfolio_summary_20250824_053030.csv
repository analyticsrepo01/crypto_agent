Per mandatory fee-aware sell rule #4, an unprofitable position must be HELD until it becomes profitable or reaches a stop-loss. However, the market technicals are strongly bearish. Price is trading below both the 20-period ($107770.10) and 50-period ($107762.55) Simple Moving Averages. The MACD shows a strong bearish crossover with a negative histogram (-5.629), indicating downward momentum. Current volume is extremely high (78,132,010), representing a 31312065.10x average, which confirms strong bearish price action. The AI Trend Analysis is ""BEARISH"" with ""MEDIUM"" confidence. While indicators like Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) suggest oversold conditions and a potential short-term bounce, the dominant trend and momentum indicators are unequivocally bearish. Given the aggressive trading mode, this would typically be a strong SELL signal, but the mandatory profitability rule for the existing position overrides immediate action. The HIGH priority reflects the need to closely monitor for a profitable exit opportunity or a stop-loss trigger given the strong bearish outlook.",8.0,HIGH,BEARISH,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,45.45454545454545,107770.097,107762.55040000001,-5.6288942178083765,-0.10000201284080912,31312065.098434553,AGGRESSIVE

For overall market conditions, while the 5-minute timeframe exhibits upward momentum with exceptionally high current volume (5,000,000x average) and the price trading above both SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating short-term bullishness, there are significant mitigating factors. The AI trend analysis, despite being bullish with medium confidence, explicitly warns of an ""overbought condition indicated by the price being above the upper Bollinger Band [suggesting] a potential short-term retracement."" Furthermore, both RSI (50.0) and MACD (0.000) are neutral, not providing strong confirmation. Critically, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents medium-term trend confirmation, a factor weighted more heavily for overall direction. Given the ""Aggressive Trading Mode,"" buying into a potentially overbought short-term rally without medium-term confirmation carries high risk of a retracement, which conflicts with maximizing profit through decisive action.
