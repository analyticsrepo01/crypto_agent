This loss is significantly below the 2% stop-loss threshold (approx. $14.99). Per mandatory trading rules, an unprofitable position must be HELD unless a stop-loss is triggered. For new trades, the 5-minute technical analysis presents mixed signals: MACD is bullish (Histogram 1.944, Line above Signal), but price is below both the 20 and 50 period SMAs (bearish). All key momentum oscillators (RSI, Williams %R, Stochastic K) are at neutral midpoints (50.0). The AI Trend Analysis explicitly states ""NEUTRAL"" trend with ""LOW Confidence"" and ""HIGH Risk,"" further indicating indecision. While current volume is extremely high (31M x average), it does not provide clear directional conviction given the mixed price action. Critically, no 1-hour timeframe data is available, preventing a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and trend confirmation, which is essential for higher-confidence trades in aggressive mode. Without a clear directional signal and with high risk flagged by the AI, an aggressive HOLD is the decisive action to avoid unnecessary risk and preserve capital, adhering to both the mandatory profitability rules and strategic trading principles.",5.0,LOW,NEUTRAL,LOW,HIGH,50.00057970342342,107791.66,107773.33200000001,1.9443814677315423,-0.10001127932810121,31366919.659048647,AGGRESSIVE

Technical analysis presents a mixed picture, preventing a strong BUY signal. While MACD shows a bullish cross and positive histogram, indicating some short-term upward momentum, price is trading below key moving averages (SMA20 < SMA50, a bearish crossover), and the AI trend analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with medium confidence, citing high volume on a negative price day and negative OBV. Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are high, nearing overbought conditions which could signal caution. With no news to provide a strong sentiment boost, and conflicting technical signals, initiating a new trade (BUY or SELL) is not advisable under the aggressive trading mode which prioritizes clear momentum.

Critically, the current holding of 5.4015 shares exceeds the 'Max shares per stock: 5' constraint, necessitating an immediate reduction of the position. The market exhibits extreme flatness with a 0% daily change, a neutral AI trend, and all moving averages clustered tightly together, indicating no clear directional momentum despite a massive volume ratio spike. The MACD shows a very slight bearish cross, while other short-term indicators like RSI are neutral. Given the aggressive trading mode, the lack of a compelling bullish signal, the current profitability, and the portfolio constraint violation, selling the entire position is the most decisive and prudent action to lock in profits, rebalance the portfolio, and free up capital for future high-momentum opportunities.",6.0,MEDIUM,NEUTRAL,MEDIUM,LOW,50.0,120.354,120.35520000000001,-0.0015691208775871226,0.0,34399.9222109577,AGGRESSIVE

The current price of $577.66 trading above both SMA 20 ($575.53) and SMA 50 ($575.53) further confirms a short-term uptrend. While MACD and RSI are neutral, and the AI's reasoning noted ""weak bullish momentum"" and a potential ""overbought condition"" (unsupported by raw RSI data), these are overridden by the dominant volume signal and positive price action.
