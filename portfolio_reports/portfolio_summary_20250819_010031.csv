Crucially, no 1-hour timeframe data is available, which prevents the required medium-term trend confirmation and dual timeframe alignment for the BALANCED TRADING MODE. This violates the strategy's mandate to ""Weight 1-hour trends MORE heavily"", ""Demand multiple confirming indicators"", and ""Focus on strong technical alignment"" across timeframes, and limits confidence. The extremely high volume ratio also suggests potential for high volatility, which balanced mode aims to avoid. No news data is available to provide additional conviction.
