Technical analysis for a new trade is mixed: While MACD shows bullish momentum (line above signal, positive histogram) and price is above both SMA 20 and SMA 50, aggressive momentum oscillators like Williams %R (-11.8) and Stochastic K (88.2) indicate strong overbought conditions, suggesting a potential pullback. The AI trend analysis, despite being BULLISH, explicitly warns of ""low confidence"" and a ""weakening trend susceptible to a pullback"" due to these overbought conditions and missing data. The calculated technical score of 2 is below the aggressive mode's threshold of 4+ for initiating a BUY, indicating weak overall technical strength for new entry.

Therefore, the existing position must be held. For new trades, despite the aggressive trading mode, the technical signals for ETHUSD are highly contradictory. While the current price is above major moving averages (SMA 20 & 50) and volume is extremely high (729355.89x average), suggesting short-term bullish momentum, this is countered by bearish MACD signals (line below signal, negative histogram) and overbought conditions indicated by Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0). The AI trend analysis also highlights this contradiction, stating ""strong upward momentum and overbought conditions... contradicted by bearish MACD signals... suggesting potential for a near-term pullback or reversal"" with ""NEUTRAL"" trend, ""LOW"" confidence, and ""HIGH"" risk. The overall technical score is 1. While this score falls under the ""6- as actionable for SELL"" rule for aggressive mode, the primary constraint of not selling an unprofitable position takes precedence for the existing holding. Furthermore, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a higher-confidence assessment of the medium-term trend, crucial for decisive action in aggressive trading.
