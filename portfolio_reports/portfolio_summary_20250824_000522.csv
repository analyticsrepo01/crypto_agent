Technically, the 5-minute timeframe presents a mixed and high-risk picture. While price is above both SMA 20 and SMA 50, showing a strong +2.04% daily change, and current volume is extremely high, key momentum indicators are severely overbought. Williams %R (-3.6) and Stochastic K (96.4) are both flashing strong reversal signals, indicating the current upward move is likely unsustainable. MACD also remains bearish below its signal line. The AI trend analysis is BEARISH, albeit with LOW confidence, and highlights a HIGH risk level. Given these conflicting technical signals, with strong overbought momentum indicators suggesting a potential reversal, but also bullish price action, and the overriding constraint to hold an unprofitable position, waiting for clearer directional confirmation or for the position to become profitable is the most appropriate action for the existing shares.",3.6,LOW,BEARISH,LOW,HIGH,50.0,107656.899,107719.4274,-80.44544137131078,2.0408196103289264,26925498.429558843,AGGRESSIVE

Furthermore, the current volume is exceptionally high (77,825,880), representing a staggering 713,562.01x the average, strongly confirming the upward price movement. The AI trend analysis also corroborates a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. Although 1-hour data is unavailable, the 5-minute timeframe provides decisive bullish signals for an aggressive trading strategy focused on momentum.

The AI trend analysis also indicates a BULLISH outlook.
