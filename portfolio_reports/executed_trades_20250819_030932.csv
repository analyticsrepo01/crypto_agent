The portfolio currently holds 11 shares of AAPL (1 share @ $231.88 and 10 shares @ $150.00), which exceeds the ""Max shares per stock: 10"" constraint. The specific 1-share position highlighted in the ""Current Position Profitability Analysis"" is unprofitable (Net P&L: $-2.41) and thus, per the mandatory rule, CANNOT be sold at this time. To comply with the maximum share constraint while adhering to the unprofitable sell rule, 1 share from the highly profitable 10-share block (purchased at $150.00) must be sold. Selling 1 share from this profitable block will bring the total shares held to 10 and result in a significant net profit.",N/A,231.64999389648438,231.41834390258788,-0.1,231.88164389038084,-0.4632999877929649,231.64999389648438,231.41834390258788,BACKTEST_030926,Filled,1,0.1,9999.661860008238,9892.940212150572,3
