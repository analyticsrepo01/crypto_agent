While the current price is weakly above the SMA 20 and SMA 50, suggesting a slight bullish lean, the MACD histogram (-10.409) and MACD line (-10.457, below signal) show strong bearish momentum. The AI trend is 'BULLISH' but with 'LOW confidence,' explicitly citing a ""strong bearish MACD signal and negative OBV"" which indicates underlying selling pressure. Volume is exceptionally high, confirming activity, but the direction is ambiguous given the contradictory technicals. Crucially, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents any medium-term trend confirmation, which is a major constraint for a high-conviction trade. Given the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, a BUY requires strong, consistent momentum and confirmation.

Critically, 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, preventing a medium-term trend confirmation, which is essential for our strategy. As an aggressive trader, we prioritize momentum and clear signals for decisive action. Currently, there are no discernible bullish or bearish signals meeting our technical score thresholds (4+ for BUY, 6- for SELL).
