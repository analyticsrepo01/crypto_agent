Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are at high levels, indicating intense buying pressure; in an aggressive crypto trading context, these are strong buy confirmations. Crucially, the current volume (77,789,730) is astronomically high relative to the average, reflected in a 31059090.19x Volume Ratio, providing overwhelming conviction to the bullish price movement.
