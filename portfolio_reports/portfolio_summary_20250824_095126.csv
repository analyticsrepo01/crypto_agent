While the MACD displays a bearish signal (Line 81.311 < Signal 109.455) suggesting a potential downward bias and the AI trend analysis leans bearish (low confidence), the current position is unprofitable with a Net P&L of $-0.76 after accounting for round-trip fees. This loss does not meet the 2%+ stop-loss trigger. According to mandatory trading rules, an unprofitable position must be held if it has not hit a stop-loss.

MACD exhibits a strong bullish crossover with a positive and growing histogram, signaling increasing buying pressure. Momentum indicators like Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are in strong buying territory, indicating significant upward strength. Crucially, the current volume is exceptionally high at 77,625,073, far exceeding the Volume MA by a factor of 716475.08x average, which provides strong confirmation for the bullish move. As per aggressive trading mode, we prioritize momentum and volume, both of which are overwhelmingly positive here, and consider technical scores 4+ as actionable for BUY.

My current position is profitable ($+0.10 net P&L after fees), satisfying the profitability criteria for a hold. As the ""Max shares per stock"" constraint of 5 is already exceeded (current 5.4 shares), I cannot initiate a new BUY order.
