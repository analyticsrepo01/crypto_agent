Key momentum indicators, Stochastic K (95.2) and Williams %R (-4.8), are in highly overbought territory, signaling a strong likelihood of a downward price correction or pullback, which is a powerful bearish indicator in crypto. The current price ($107700.02) is also trading below both the 20-period ($107791.66) and 50-period ($107771.18) Simple Moving Averages, reinforcing short-term bearish sentiment. The AI trend analysis further confirms a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence, explicitly citing negative price movement on high volume and the overbought momentum indicators. While MACD shows a bullish signal, it is strongly contradicted by multiple other indicators and the overarching AI assessment. The lack of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a higher confidence decision for entry, and the prevailing bearish signals do not meet the aggressive mode's ""4+ technical score for BUY"" threshold.",5.0,MEDIUM,BEARISH,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,50.0,107791.66,107771.17520000001,4.702158579192583,-0.10000201284080912,31649275.516200706,AGGRESSIVE

Crucially, the current volume (77,384,643) is astronomically high, with a Volume Ratio of 710806.17x average, which provides extremely strong confirmation of buying pressure and momentum, aligning with the aggressive trading strategy's emphasis on volume.
