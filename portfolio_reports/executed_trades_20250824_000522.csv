The MACD histogram is positive (0.008), with the MACD line (0.056) maintaining a bullish position above its signal line (0.049). This, coupled with a clear bullish crossover where SMA 20 ($2481.93) is above SMA 50 ($2481.78), indicates a robust uptrend. Furthermore, the current volume is exceptionally high (77,825,880), representing a staggering 713,562.01x the average, strongly confirming the upward price movement. The AI trend analysis also corroborates a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. Although 1-hour data is unavailable, the 5-minute timeframe provides decisive bullish signals for an aggressive trading strategy focused on momentum. The current position is profitable (Net P&L +$0.44), and according to aggressive trading rules, we should maximize profit by capitalizing on strong upward momentum rather than selling.",N/A,2485.41,50.0,sim_1756008309,Submitted,0.020117,0,0,0.000108,2025-08-24,0.0,900.0,25

Crucially, current volume is extremely high (5,000,000) with a 5000000.00x average volume ratio, which is a strong indicator of bullish momentum and market interest, aligning with the aggressive trading strategy to prioritize volume. The AI trend analysis also indicates a BULLISH outlook. While MACD and RSI are currently neutral and the AI reasoning mentions potential overbought conditions (not supported by explicit RSI data), the overall technical score of 5 (meeting the 4+ threshold for BUY) driven by strong volume and price action above MAs warrants a BUY in this aggressive mode. The existing position is currently unprofitable to sell and does not meet stop-loss criteria, so it will be held while adding new shares to capitalize on the bullish momentum.",N/A,577.66,50.0,sim_1756008310,Submitted,0.086556,0,0,0.00013,2025-08-24,0.0,900.0,25
