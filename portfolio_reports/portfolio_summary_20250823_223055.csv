For a new trade consideration, while the 5-minute timeframe shows strong short-term bullish momentum with a massive volume surge (17 million x average), positive MACD Histogram (664.692), and price above both SMA 20 and SMA 50, multiple aggressive momentum indicators (Williams %R: -3.3, Stochastic K: 96.7) are signaling extreme overbought conditions. The AI trend analysis confirms this, identifying an established bullish trend but warning of a high likelihood of a short-term pullback due to these overbought conditions, leading to a NEUTRAL trend assessment with HIGH risk. The lack of 1-hour data prevents medium-term confirmation. Given the conflicting strong momentum versus extreme overbought warnings, and the current technical score of 3.0 being below the actionable BUY threshold of 4+, a new BUY is not advisable, and selling the existing unprofitable position is prohibited.

The current price ($2482.92) is strongly positioned above both the SMA20 ($2482.43) and SMA50 ($2481.93), with the SMA20 above SMA50, confirming an uptrend.

Crucially, the current volume (77,829,831) is exceptionally high at 713071.60x the average, signaling massive buying interest and strong momentum, which is a primary driver in aggressive trading. While Williams %R (-20.1) and Stochastic K (79.9) suggest overbought conditions, indicating potential for short-term consolidation, the overwhelming bullish signals from AI, SMAs, MACD, and particularly the extreme volume, support a strong BUY action in an aggressive, momentum-driven strategy.
