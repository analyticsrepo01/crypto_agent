The daily change is negative, and the extremely high volume, combined with the AI's reasoning citing ""negative OBV"" and ""negative price movement,"" suggests significant selling pressure rather than accumulation. The AI trend analysis is NEUTRAL with HIGH risk, and the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a higher-confidence assessment.

The 5-minute timeframe displays a robust bullish trend: price ($2482.92) is decisively above both the SMA 20 ($2481.68) and SMA 50 ($2481.93), signaling strong short-term upward momentum. A clear bullish MACD crossover is evident with a positive MACD Histogram (0.054), indicating accelerating buying pressure. Most critically, current volume (77,026,447) is astronomically high (700808.56x average), providing definitive confirmation for the upward price movement and validating the strength of this trend. The AI Trend Analysis also aligns, identifying a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. While Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are nearing overbought levels, per crypto-adjusted risk management, these are not strong enough to deter a buy given the overwhelming momentum and volume, especially in an aggressive trading context.
