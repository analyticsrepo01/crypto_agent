The AI Trend Analysis explicitly identifies a BEARISH trend with medium confidence, citing these overbought signals and price action. Given the aggressive trading mode's emphasis on acting on strong technical signals and the specific crypto-adjusted rule that RSI >80 or <20 are stronger signals (which these overbought indicators emulate), initiating a BUY position now would be against strong reversal warnings.

Crucially, current volume is an astounding 706,667 times the average, providing extremely strong confirmation of the bullish price action, a key priority in aggressive trading. While Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are in overbought territory and the AI analysis warns of a potential short-term pullback due to a bearish OBV divergence (not explicitly provided in data), the aggressive trading mode dictates prioritizing strong momentum and volume for profit maximization. Given the technical score of 8, which is well above the actionable BUY threshold of 4, and the lack of 1-hour data to suggest a divergent medium-term trend, the immediate strong bullish signals warrant a decisive BUY action, accepting the higher risk for potential higher returns.
