As per mandatory trading rules, a position must not be sold at a loss unless it meets the 2%+ stop-loss trigger, which is not the case here. Therefore, holding the position is required. From a pure technical analysis perspective, the AI Trend Analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence. This is supported by the price trading below both the SMA 20 ($107759.32) and SMA 50 ($107762.55), a negative daily change of -0.10%, and exceptionally high volume (Volume Ratio: 31667536.58x average) which is confirming the underlying selling pressure. While the MACD Line (4.655) is significantly above its Signal Line (-0.260), indicating a strong bullish momentum, this signal is contradicted by the overall bearish trend identified by the AI and the price action relative to moving averages. The aggressive trading mode prioritizes momentum and volume, and in this instance, high volume is validating the bearish price movement.

Furthermore, ATR and 20-day Volatility are both 0.000, confirming the absence of any price movement. While current volume is high, the Volume MA is 0, making the volume ratio unreliable and suggesting data anomalies or a testing environment where price is static.

The AI trend analysis also confirms a ""NEUTRAL"" trend with ""LOW"" confidence due to ""extreme market stagnation"" and contradictory/unreliable raw indicator values. As an aggressive trader, I prioritize momentum and clear technical signals, neither of which are present here.
