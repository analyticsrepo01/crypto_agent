However, the Williams %R and Stochastic K are both at overbought levels (0.0 and 100.0 respectively), suggesting a potential pullback or consolidation. The price is currently flat (+0.00%) and below the short-term SMAs. No 1-hour data is available for broader trend confirmation, leading to reliance solely on 5-minute data. The AI trend analysis aligns with this mixed view, indicating a 'BULLISH' trend but with 'LOW' confidence due to the overbought oscillators.
