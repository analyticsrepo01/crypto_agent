Furthermore, Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are both in the upper range, suggesting overbought conditions and a potential for a downward reversal. While the AI trend analysis indicates ""NEUTRAL"" with ""LOW"" confidence and ""no active trend,"" it explicitly notes a ""bearish bias"" confirmed by MACD and price below moving averages, which aligns with our technical assessment. Given the aggressive trading mode, which prioritizes momentum, decisive action, and accepts higher risk for higher potential returns, and with an existing short position (-0.0006 shares), adding to the short position (SELL) is the appropriate action to capitalize on the bearish signals.
