While Williams %R and Stochastic are nearing overbought levels, suggesting a potential short-term reversal, the overall confluence of strong momentum signals and extreme volume, coupled with the AI's 'LOW Confidence' in its bearish trend due to these very bullish indicators, outweighs the lagging bearish moving average signals for an aggressive BUY.
