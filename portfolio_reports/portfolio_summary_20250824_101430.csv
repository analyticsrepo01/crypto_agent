The MACD histogram is negative (-25.969), and the MACD line (111.090) is below its signal line (137.060), confirming a bearish crossover. Both Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are in overbought territory, indicating potential for a downside reversal. The current price ($107700.02) is below the short-term SMA 20 ($107780.88), suggesting immediate weakness. Volume is extremely high (78,002,288) compared to its MA, which, coupled with bearish momentum, points to significant selling pressure. The AI trend analysis confirms a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence and HIGH risk. Despite these strong bearish technical signals (Technical Score: 2), our current BTCUSD position is unprofitable (Net P&L: $-0.76) and has not reached the emergency stop-loss trigger (2% loss from purchase price of $107801.06, which would be below $105645.04).
