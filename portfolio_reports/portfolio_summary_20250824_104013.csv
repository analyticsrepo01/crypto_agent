Current 5-minute technicals for ETHUSD are overwhelmingly bullish: the price ($2482.93) is above both the SMA 20 ($2482.30) and SMA 50 ($2482.03), which are also in bullish alignment (SMA 20 > SMA 50). MACD shows a fresh bullish crossover (Line 0.075 > Signal 0.048) with a positive histogram (0.026), indicating strong upward momentum. RSI (54.5) is healthy, and both Williams %R (-20.1) and Stochastic K (79.9) signal robust bullish strength approaching overbought conditions. Critically, volume is exceptionally high (710237.21x average), providing strong confirmation for this positive price movement, which is a key priority in aggressive mode. The AI trend analysis independently confirms a HIGH confidence BULLISH outlook, reasoning that price is above key moving averages with strong positive momentum and high volume. Given these combined strong bullish indicators and the absence of any negative news, adding 0.001 shares to the position is justified to capitalize on the confirmed upward trend and leverage the current momentum.",9.0,HIGH,BULLISH,HIGH,MEDIUM,54.542124542124625,2482.3010000000004,2482.0280000000002,0.026428611157456608,0.10038541549079122,710237.2074278182,AGGRESSIVE

As per mandatory trading rules, an unprofitable position must be held. Despite this, the technical analysis indicates a strong bullish setup: MACD has a bullish crossover with a positive histogram (0.003), and both Williams %R (-96.3) and Stochastic K (3.7) are in extremely oversold conditions, signaling strong potential for an upward bounce. Critically, there's a massive volume spike (Current Volume: 32,412,608 vs Volume MA: 950, a 34134.49x ratio) indicating significant buying interest and potential for a strong price movement. The AI trend analysis confirms a BULLISH trend with MEDIUM confidence based on momentum. However, a new BUY order is not possible for LTCUSD as the current position (5.4015 shares) already exceeds the ""Max shares per stock: 5"" constraint. Therefore, the only allowable action is to HOLD the existing position, anticipating a recovery into profitability based on the strong underlying bullish technicals.",10.0,HIGH,BULLISH,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,55.55555555555556,120.36599999999999,120.36480000000002,0.0029153050382091177,0.0,34134.48558102594,AGGRESSIVE

The 5-minute technicals show a neutral RSI (50.0) and flat MACD (0.000). While price is slightly above SMAs, the overall momentum is not strong, and the volume and volatility data are highly ambiguous (high current volume but zero Volume MA and ATR). Given the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, we prioritize strong momentum and volume for BUY signals, which are not clearly present here, and an ""overbought"" condition further dampens BUY enthusiasm.
