While the 5-minute MACD shows a bullish crossover (MACD Line 0.160 > Signal 0.041) and Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are near overbought levels indicating recent short-term upward momentum, these bullish signals are outweighed by the overall bearish trend, price action below SMAs, and the high-volume-bearish confirmation from the AI.

While current volume is high (5,000,000), the associated 0% price change and 0 ATR suggest this volume is not leading to directional movement or is indicative of specific market conditions (e.g., testing or illiquidity prior to a single block trade) that do not generate actionable signals for aggressive trading. With no 1-hour data available, we cannot confirm any broader trend. In aggressive trading mode, while we accept higher risk, this is for higher potential returns driven by clear signals.
