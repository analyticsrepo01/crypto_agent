Furthermore, the extremely high Volume Ratio (1928880.00x average) suggests unusual activity and potential for increased volatility, which the balanced strategy mandates avoiding. Most critically, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents dual-timeframe trend confirmation, which is essential for high-confidence trades and robust technical alignment.
