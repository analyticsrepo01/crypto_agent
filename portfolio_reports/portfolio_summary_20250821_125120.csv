The current price of $107700.02 is not a 2%+ loss from the purchase price of $107700.02. Therefore, liquidating at this point would incur a guaranteed loss after fees. From a technical perspective, the AI Trend Analysis indicates a ""BEARISH"" trend with ""MEDIUM Confidence"", supported by the price being below SMA 20 and SMA 50, and a negative MACD histogram, suggesting bearish momentum. While short-term oscillators like Stochastic K (80.0) and Williams %R (-20.0) are in overbought territory, potentially signaling a short-term pullback or a top to a bounce within a downtrend, the overall sentiment remains bearish. Volume is exceptionally high, indicating significant market activity, but without price movement, it suggests indecision with a bearish bias. Given the aggressive trading mode, if profitability allowed, a sell signal would be strong due to the bearish indicators. However, adhering to the critical fee-aware sell rules takes precedence for existing positions.
