For new positions, despite strong daily price appreciation (+4.11%) and exceptionally high volume, which suggests short-term momentum, technical indicators on the 5-minute timeframe are mixed. The price is above SMA 20 and SMA 50 (bullish), but MACD shows bearish momentum (Line < Signal, Histogram negative), and oscillators (RSI, Stochastic, Williams %R) are neutral to bearish. This leads to a technical score of 3, which falls below the aggressive trading mode's threshold of 4+ for a BUY action. Crucially, the complete absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents robust medium-term trend confirmation, which is weighted more heavily in the dual timeframe analysis. The AI trend analysis corroborates this, indicating a ""NEUTRAL"" trend with ""LOW"" confidence and ""HIGH"" risk due to conflicting signals and missing data. Therefore, the prudent action is to HOLD existing shares and refrain from initiating new buys due to insufficient technical strength for aggressive entry and critical missing trend data.",3.0,LOW,NEUTRAL,LOW,HIGH,45.61720168322963,105915.276,107024.93400000001,-356.07909791947293,4.112662059738626,15768837.656247681,AGGRESSIVE

Crucially, the current volume is exceptionally high (720676.53x average), providing strong confirmation for the bullish trend and indicating significant buying interest. While Stochastic K and Williams %R are in oversold territory, within a confirmed strong bullish trend, this can present an opportunistic entry point for further upside. Given the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, maximizing profit by adding to a position with such strong technical signals and volume is prioritized.
