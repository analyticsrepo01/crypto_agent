Critically, in this AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, the current volume is extraordinarily high with a Volume Ratio of 31556224.57x average, signaling significant momentum and market interest, which is a primary driver for a BUY decision. While the MACD shows a strong bearish cross with a negative histogram (MACD Line -13.215, Signal -2.774), presenting a conflicting signal and inherent risk, the dominant momentum and bullish price action above key moving averages warrant a BUY. The existing position of 0.00649492 shares is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L After Fees: -$0.008), therefore, per mandatory rules, this specific position must be HELD.

As per the critical fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position must be held unless an emergency stop-loss is triggered. Technically, the 5-minute data presents mixed signals. The AI Trend Analysis indicates a 'BEARISH' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence, citing the price trading below key moving averages and negative daily change, suggesting underlying selling pressure. This is reinforced by the current price of $2480.44 being below both SMA 20 ($2482.05) and SMA 50 ($2482.28). However, short-term momentum indicators like MACD Histogram (0.161), Williams %R (-20.1), and Stochastic K (79.9) all suggest recent upward momentum or are nearing overbought levels, indicating short-term buying pressure or a potential bounce. Volume is exceptionally high (715134.75x average), confirming significant market activity, though its overall directional impact is ambiguous given the conflicting signals. With no 1-hour data available and no news sentiment, the decision is primarily driven by the mandatory rule to hold unprofitable positions that are not at an emergency stop-loss, while acknowledging the conflicting technical forces at play.",4.0,MEDIUM,BEARISH,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,50.0,2482.052,2482.276,0.16129640824437774,-0.09988239653311497,715134.7534875727,AGGRESSIVE

Moving Averages (SMA 20 at $120.37 above SMA 50 at $120.36) show bullish alignment. Momentum indicators like Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are deeply oversold, which, according to crypto-adjusted risk management, are strong BUY signals suggesting a potential bullish reversal or breakout. Critically, the current volume is exceptionally high (34142.89x average), indicating strong market interest and supporting an imminent upward price movement, which aligns with the aggressive mode's prioritization of momentum and volume. The AI Trend Analysis also confirms a BULLISH outlook with MEDIUM confidence. While the MACD shows a slight bearish crossover, its values are near zero, indicating weak momentum and is significantly outweighed by the other strong bullish indicators. Given the aggressive trading mode's objective to maximize profit and the robust bullish signals, holding the profitable position is recommended to capitalize on the anticipated upside.

From a technical analysis perspective, the 5-minute timeframe shows the current price ($577.66) is above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50 ($575.53), indicating a short-term bullish bias.

The AI Trend Analysis confirms a BULLISH trend with Medium Confidence, reasoning that price is above key moving averages supported by strong volume.
