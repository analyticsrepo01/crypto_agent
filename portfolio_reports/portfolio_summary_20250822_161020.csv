In an aggressive trading mode, prioritizing profit maximization and being quick to exit, selling a profitable position amidst high uncertainty, conflicting signals, bearish short-term momentum (MACD), and the absence of critical medium-term trend data (1-hour) is the most prudent action to lock in gains and avoid potential reversals or prolonged sideways movement.
