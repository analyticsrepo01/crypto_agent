The current price ($107807.83) is robustly trading above both the SMA 20 ($107764.71) and SMA 50 ($107771.18), signaling a clear uptrend. MACD Histogram is positive (2.504) and the MACD line is above its signal line, confirming strong bullish momentum. Both Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are in very strong buying territory, indicative of significant buying pressure and market enthusiasm. Critically, the current volume (78,012,222) is an astounding 31,497,908.21x the average, providing overwhelming confirmation and conviction for the bullish price action. The AI Trend Analysis also confidently identifies a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. As an aggressive trader, we are actively maximizing profit through decisive action and accepting higher risk for higher potential returns. While the existing small position is currently unprofitable to sell (net P&L: $-0.01 after fees), this strong, confirmed bullish signal warrants adding to the position to capitalize on the powerful momentum and maximize potential gains, rather than missing out on further upside. The current unprofitable position will be held as we add new shares.",N/A,107807.83,50.0,sim_1756017983,Submitted,0.00046379,0,0,0.000147,2025-08-24,0.0,900.0,50

This is further supported by the current price ($2482.92) maintaining above both the 20-period ($2481.93) and 50-period ($2482.08) Simple Moving Averages, suggesting short-term upward strength. While the MACD exhibits a bearish signal (histogram below zero and MACD line below signal line), the overwhelming volume and price action above key moving averages counterbalance this, particularly under an aggressive strategy that prioritizes momentum. The existing position is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L: $-0.26), making a BUY action strategically aligned to potentially capitalize on the indicated momentum or average down the position. The absence of 1-hour data limits long-term trend confirmation, resulting in a Medium confidence.",N/A,2482.92,50.0,sim_1756017983,Submitted,0.020138,0,0,0.000517,2025-08-24,0.0,900.0,50
