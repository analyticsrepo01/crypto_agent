This suggests a strong downward bias. However, short-term oscillators (Williams %R and Stochastic K) are in extremely oversold territory, which often precedes a near-term bounce. This creates conflicting signals for an immediate trade entry. Furthermore, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data and valid volume data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and assessment of conviction, leading to incomplete information. The AI explicitly notes a ""HIGH Risk Level"" for this situation. In 'BALANCED TRADING MODE', the strategy prioritizes capital preservation, demands multiple confirming indicators, and requires strong technical alignment, while avoiding trades during high volatility. The current conflicting indicators, missing data, and high-risk assessment mean there is no strong technical alignment for either a BUY or a SELL, despite the underlying bearish trend.
