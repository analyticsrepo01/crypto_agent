session_20250818_093728_3660,8,BALANCED,2025-08-18T10:25:34.593489,AAPL,SELL,1,HIGH,"The comprehensive analysis indicates strong bearish technicals for AAPL, with the AI Trend Analysis providing a very low technical score of 1/10 and high confidence in a BEARISH trend. This is further confirmed by a bearish MACD crossover (MACD line below signal line) and the price trading below key short-term moving averages (SMA 20, EMA 12, EMA 26) and the middle Bollinger Band. The news sentiment is NEUTRAL (score: -0.20), which is borderline negative and aligns with avoiding a BUY recommendation and does not contradict a SELL. According to the Balanced Trading Mode, a technical score of 4 or less warrants a high-priority SELL, and the neutral/negative news aligns with these weak technical signals for capital preservation. Selling the existing 1 share aligns with risk management to prevent further potential losses from a confirmed bearish trend.",N/A,231.56,231.56,243,Filled,1.0,0.0,231.4612,1.019735,973.44,480.46000000000004,3
