The current price is trading above both SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating a short-term upward trend. Crucially, the current volume is exceptionally high (5,000,000x average), signaling strong market interest and momentum, which is prioritized in aggressive trading. While the MACD and RSI are currently neutral, the positive daily change supports the bullish sentiment. The AI trend analysis also identifies a BULLISH trend. Although the existing position is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L $-0.01), this rule strictly applies to SELLING the position. In aggressive mode, with strong bullish indicators, the strategy is to maximize profit by taking decisive action. Adding to the position increases exposure to the potential upside without violating the 'do not sell at a loss' rule for the existing shares. The lack of 1-hour data and the AI's conflicting detail about Bollinger Bands flagging as overbought (despite RSI 50) temper the confidence slightly, but the overall momentum and volume are too strong to ignore for an aggressive buy.",N/A,577.66,50.0,sim_1756027129,Submitted,0.086556,0,0,0.000113,2025-08-24,0.0,950.0,61
