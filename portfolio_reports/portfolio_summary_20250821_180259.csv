Despite current price flatness, the MACD has confirmed a bearish crossover, and the price is trading below both the 20 and 50-period Simple Moving Averages, signaling short-term weakness. Crucially, both the Williams %R (-4.8) and Stochastic K (95.2) are in extremely overbought territory. When combined with the AI's 'BEARISH' trend analysis and 'HIGH' risk assessment, these overbought conditions within an established bearish context strongly suggest an imminent downward correction, as explicitly noted by the AI's ""bearish divergence"" and ""likelihood of a downward correction.""

The current loss is significantly less than the 2% stop-loss threshold. From a technical perspective, the 5-minute timeframe shows conflicting signals: bullish momentum indicators (MACD line above signal, positive MACD histogram, Stochastic K at 79.9, Williams %R at -20.1) are counterbalanced by the price being below both SMA 20 and SMA 50, and a negative daily change. Volume is extremely high, which could indicate significant activity, but the AI's ""negative price movement on high volume with negative OBV confirmation"" suggests underlying selling pressure.
