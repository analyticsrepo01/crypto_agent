Momentum indicators are extremely strong: MACD shows a clear bullish crossover with a positive histogram, and both Williams %R and Stochastic K are at their upper limits (100.0 / -0.0), signaling powerful buying pressure. Crucially, the current volume is an astonishing 33972.78x its average, confirming robust market interest and conviction in the bullish direction. Given the ""AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE"" and the mandate to ""MAXIMIZE PROFIT"" by prioritizing momentum and volume, adding to the current profitable position is justified to capitalize on this strong uptrend. My current position is profitable, but the technical signals are overwhelmingly bullish, indicating further upside potential.",N/A,120.42,50.0,sim_1756001932,Submitted,0.415213,0,0,0.000113,2025-08-23,0.0,900.0,4

The daily change is positive (+0.37%). Critically, current volume is exceptionally high (5,000,000x average), signaling significant buying interest and strong momentum, which is a key priority in aggressive trading mode. The AI trend analysis confirms a BULLISH outlook with a ""bullish MACD signal."" While the AI notes an overbought condition, in an aggressive strategy, current strong momentum and volume are prioritized for quick entry. The technical score of 7 (well above the 4+ threshold for BUY) combined with the strong volume confirms a high-priority BUY signal. The existing position remains unprofitable to sell, so the strategy is to hold the existing shares and add to the position to capitalize on the confirmed bullish momentum.",N/A,577.66,50.0,sim_1756001932,Submitted,0.086556,0,0,0.000133,2025-08-23,0.0,900.0,4
