Both Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are deep in overbought territory, but in crypto's trending markets, this frequently signals strong, sustained buying pressure rather than an immediate reversal. The most compelling factor is the extraordinary current volume of 77,723,200, which is an astonishing 30 million times the average, confirming immense market interest and momentum behind the price movement. The AI trend analysis corroborates this with a HIGH confidence BULLISH trend.
