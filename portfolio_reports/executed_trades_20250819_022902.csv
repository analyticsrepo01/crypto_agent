MACD indicators show a clear bullish trend with the MACD line above the signal line and a positive histogram. The AI Trend Analysis confirms a ""BULLISH"" trend with ""HIGH"" confidence based on these indicators. Critically, the current volume is exceptionally high (150104x average), signaling strong buying interest and confirming the upward price movement. While the RSI (72.9) is in overbought territory, this can be sustained during strong trends and is outweighed by multiple confirming indicators. The lack of 1-hour data prevents comprehensive dual-timeframe alignment, which limits the overall confidence despite strong short-term technicals.
