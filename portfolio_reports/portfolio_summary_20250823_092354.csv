MACD is slightly bearish but near zero, also suggesting weak momentum. Despite the extreme oversold readings from Williams %R and Stochastic K, these are unreliable in a market with virtually no price movement, likely reflecting the price being stuck at the bottom of its recent range rather than signaling an imminent bounce.
