Price is consistently trading below both the 5-minute SMA 20 ($107753.93) and SMA 50 ($107758.24). The MACD histogram (-1.475) is negative, and the MACD line (-1.177) is below its signal line (0.298), indicating clear bearish momentum and a strong sell signal. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, classifying the trend as BEARISH with MEDIUM confidence, citing price below moving averages and a bearish MACD crossover. The extremely high Volume Ratio (31157878.72x average) confirms significant activity and reinforces the strength of the current bearish momentum. While Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) suggest short-term overbought conditions within the 5-minute timeframe, implying a potential minor retracement, these are outweighed by the dominant bearish signals from SMAs, MACD, and AI. Despite these clear technical SELL signals, the current position analysis shows a Net P&L of -$0.01, classifying it as ""❌ UNPROFITABLE to sell"" and not meeting the 2%+ stop-loss trigger.

While current volume is high at 5,000,000, the Volume MA is 0, creating a misleading ratio and, more importantly, contradicting the completely flat price action.

Crucially, current volume is exceptionally high (5,000,000), which is a strong momentum indicator prioritized in this aggressive trading mode. While 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, reducing the ability to confirm medium-term trends, the strong short-term signals and significant volume provide a compelling case for a BUY given the aggressive strategy and the technical score exceeding the 4+ threshold.
