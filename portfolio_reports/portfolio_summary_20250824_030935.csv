Per the critical fee-aware sell rules, the position MUST be held. While the 5-minute chart shows bullish momentum with MACD line above signal and positive histogram, price trading above SMA 20 and SMA 50, and extremely high confirming volume, the Williams %R (-0.0) and Stochastic K (100.0) indicators are in extremely overbought territory. This signals a high risk of a short-term reversal or significant pullback. The AI trend analysis also identifies a BULLISH trend but with LOW confidence and HIGH risk due to these overbought conditions.

According to critical fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position that is not at a stop-loss trigger MUST be held. Technically, the 5-minute timeframe presents a bearish leaning. Price ($2480.44) is trading below bearishly crossed moving averages (SMA20 $2482.18 < SMA50 $2482.23), and momentum oscillators such as Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are nearing overbought levels, indicating potential for a downward reversal. The AI Trend Analysis also reports a BEARISH trend with medium confidence, further supported by significant negative price movement amplified by extremely high volume (716852.08x average). While the MACD shows a bullish crossover, it is contradicted by stronger, more immediate bearish signals from SMAs and momentum oscillators.

Crucially, volume is exceptionally high (34208.58x average), signifying strong buying interest and confirmation of the bullish trend, which is a key priority in aggressive trading. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this with a HIGH confidence BULLISH outlook, attributing the oversold momentum indicators (Williams %R -96.1, Stochastic K 3.9) as supporting a strong upward bias (potential for a bounce from a short-term dip within an uptrend). Despite missing 1-hour data, the overwhelming strength in the 5-minute timeframe, especially the extreme volume and clear price/MACD alignment, warrants an aggressive BUY. Our current position is profitable, suggesting a favorable underlying trend to add to.

Per mandatory fee-aware sell rules, we MUST recommend HOLD for this position as it is not a 2%+ stop-loss trigger. For potential new trades, the technical analysis is significantly hampered by unreliable underlying data. While the price shows a slight positive daily change (+0.37%) and is above the 5-minute SMAs, key momentum and volatility indicators are either neutral (RSI 50.0, MACD at 0.000) or outright unreliable/missing (Williams %R, Stochastic K are 'nan', ATR is 0.000 despite price movement, Volume MA is 0 making Volume Ratio misleading). The AI trend analysis confirms a 'BULLISH' trend but with 'LOW' confidence and 'HIGH' risk, explicitly stating ""unreliable underlying data for several key indicators introduce significant uncertainty."" Given these data integrity issues, even with a calculated technical score that might otherwise suggest a buy, the lack of reliable signals prevents a confident entry or adding to the position. Aggressive mode requires decisive action on strong signals, but unreliable data constitutes a fundamental lack of clear signals. Therefore, the overall recommendation is to HOLD until clearer and more reliable market data emerges to form an actionable trading signal.",3.0,LOW,BULLISH,LOW,HIGH,50.0,575.53,575.53,1.2891430857296316e-09,0.37009365280697715,5000000.0,AGGRESSIVE
