More critically, both Williams %R (-20) and Stochastic K (80) are in overbought territory, which are strong signals in crypto for a potential immediate pullback or reversal.

With no 1-hour data to confirm a medium-term trend and conflicting signals (bullish momentum vs. overbought oscillators and bearish price structure), initiating a BUY position at this point carries significant downside risk. Given the aggressive mode's objective to maximize profit and accept higher risk, entering a potentially overextended market against strong overbought signals is not advisable.
