For new trading action, the 5-minute timeframe presents a strong bullish outlook, warranting an aggressive BUY. The price ($107807.83) is trading firmly above both the SMA 20 ($107737.75) and SMA 50 ($107747.46), indicating an upward trend. A bullish MACD crossover is evident (MACD Line -2.440 > Signal -2.560), supporting momentum.

Therefore, a HOLD recommendation is required for the existing position. For potential new trades, the technical signals are highly conflicting and do not support an aggressive BUY or SELL. While the price is above key moving averages (SMA 20 & 50) with very high current volume, the MACD shows a clear bearish crossover with a negative histogram, indicating downward momentum. Other momentum indicators like RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic are largely neutral. The AI trend analysis, although labeling the trend as BULLISH, explicitly states LOW confidence due to these conflicting signals and missing data. Crucially, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents robust medium-term trend confirmation, which is vital for high-confidence trading, especially in aggressive mode.

While current volume is high at 5,000,000, the Volume MA of 0 suggests an anomalous data point rather than a clear momentum signal. No 1-hour data is available, preventing critical medium-term trend confirmation. The AI Trend Analysis indicates 'WEAK_BULLISH' with 'LOW Confidence' and 'HIGH Risk,' but its reasoning for a 'detected MACD signal' directly contradicts the raw MACD values of 0.000.

While the short-term trend indicators (MACD histogram, MACD line below signal, and price below SMAs) and the AI's overall trend identify as BEARISH, the AI's reasoning explicitly states that a ""bullish reversal or bounce is highly probable"" from these oversold levels. In AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, we prioritize capturing such high-momentum bounce opportunities for maximum profit, accepting the higher risk.

The daily change of +0.37% is positive, and the current volume of 5,000,000 is high, suggesting strong market interest, which aggressive trading prioritizes. While MACD is currently flat (0.000) and 1-hour data is unavailable (reducing medium-term trend confirmation), the overall technical score of 6 (derived from price action, positive daily change, high volume, and AI bullish trend) surpasses the aggressive mode's '4+' threshold for a BUY signal. The RSI at 50.0 is neutral, providing ample room for upward movement without being overbought, especially in crypto where RSI > 80 is a stronger signal. Given the aggressive trading mandate to maximize profit and act decisively on strong technical signals, particularly momentum and volume, a BUY action is recommended. The existing position of 0.259668 shares, which is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L $-0.01), will be held as per the critical fee-aware sell rules, as it does not meet the stop-loss trigger.
