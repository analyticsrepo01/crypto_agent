With the AI indicating ""low confidence in an immediate directional move"" due to this lack of momentum, entering a new short position (SELL) carries high risk of stagnation or whipsaw, counter to aggressive trading principles. Furthermore, the absence of 1-hour data prevents confirmation of any medium-term trend.
