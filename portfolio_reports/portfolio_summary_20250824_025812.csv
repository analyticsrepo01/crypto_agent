A bullish MACD crossover is evident with a positive histogram (2.974), signaling increasing upward momentum. Crucially, current volume is exceptionally high, with a Volume Ratio of 31556208.72x average, strongly confirming the bullish sentiment and momentum. However, momentum oscillators like RSI (44.4), Williams %R (-40.0), and Stochastic K (60.0) remain largely neutral, and critically, 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, which significantly limits the confirmation of a broader medium-term trend and reduces overall confidence. Given the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, the strong momentum indicators (MACD, Volume) and the bullish trend (price above SMAs) outweigh the neutral oscillators and missing longer-term data for a new entry, pushing the technical score above the actionable BUY threshold (4+). The existing position of 0.00603113 shares is currently unprofitable (Net P&L $-0.01), therefore, per mandatory trading rules, it must be HELD and not sold at a loss.

MACD exhibits a clear bullish crossover with a positive histogram, indicating robust upward momentum. Both Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are showing powerful bullish strength, approaching overbought levels but still signaling strong buying pressure. Price is holding above the SMA 20 and SMA 50, further confirming the uptrend. Critically, the current volume is astronomically high (720,697.05x average), providing extreme validation for the strong buying interest and confirming the bullish sentiment. No news sentiment is available to counter this strong positive signal. Given the aggressive trading mode to maximize profit and accept higher risk, this strong technical score (9/10) warrants an immediate BUY action.

Therefore, per CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULE #4, we MUST recommend HOLD. Technical analysis shows mixed signals: Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are extremely oversold, often preceding a bounce. However, MACD is weakly bearish, and the price is below the 5-minute SMAs, indicating short-term bearish pressure. The AI trend analysis confirms ""extreme consolidation"" with ""no clear trend"" and highlights ""bearish price action on high volume"" despite ""strongly oversold momentum indicators."" The massive volume spike (34337.83x average) suggests a potential significant move or capitulation, but without clear direction, it supports waiting. Given the aggressive mode, holding allows for a potential recovery to profitability based on the oversold conditions before considering an exit, as a premature, unprofitable sell would contradict the maximize profit objective.
