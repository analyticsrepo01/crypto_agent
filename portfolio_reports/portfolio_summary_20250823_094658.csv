As per the mandatory fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position must be held unless a 2%+ stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here. Therefore, the immediate action for the existing position is to HOLD. For potential new trades, the market presents highly conflicting signals. The price is currently below both the SMA20 ($107743.14) and SMA50 ($107751.77), and the daily change is negative (-0.10%), supporting a bearish structural outlook. The AI trend analysis identifies the overall trend as BEARISH, though with LOW confidence due to the conflicting indicators. Conversely, momentum indicators show bullish strength: the MACD Line (2.253) is above the MACD Signal (-4.766) with a positive Histogram (7.019), indicating a bullish crossover. Both Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are in overbought territory, suggesting strong recent buying pressure but also the potential for an imminent short-term reversal. Volume is extremely high (77,845,435), indicating strong conviction, but its directional implication is ambiguous given the mixed price and momentum signals. Critically, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis, significantly reducing confidence in any strong directional new trade recommendation. Given these conflicting signals and the lack of higher-timeframe confirmation, the most prudent action is to hold the existing position and avoid new entries until a clearer directional bias emerges.",4.0,LOW,BEARISH,LOW,MEDIUM,50.0,107743.14450000001,107751.7692,7.019324849825202,-0.10000201284080912,30842110.306808222,AGGRESSIVE
