This creates a conflicting technical picture where an underlying bearish trend is present, but short-term rebound potential from oversold levels exists. The balanced trading mode demands multiple confirming indicators for high-priority trades and strong technical alignment. Given the mixed technical signals (bearish trend vs. oversold rebound potential) and the negative news sentiment, there is insufficient alignment to justify either a high-priority BUY or a high-priority SELL.

According to ""BALANCED TRADING MODE"", a high-priority BUY requires a technical score of 6+ and multiple confirming indicators, which are absent (technical score is 4). Furthermore, news alignment with technical signals is required for high-priority trades, and here, positive news is misaligned with weak/bearish technicals.

Furthermore, momentum indicators like Stochastic K (79.7) and Williams %R (-20.3) are in overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term pullback, which adds another layer of caution.
