The current price holds above key SMAs, indicating underlying support. Crucially, volume is exceptionally high (Volume Ratio: 31306966.95x average), which, combined with oversold conditions, provides a strong signal for a decisive aggressive entry based on momentum and volume prioritization.

Both Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are at extreme oversold levels. In an aggressive trading mode, these strong oversold signals, combined with the underlying bullish price action and massive volume, suggest a high probability of an immediate upward bounce or reversal.

The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this with a BULLISH trend and a bullish MACD signal. While the AI notes the price is above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating a potential overbought condition and the RSI is neutral (50.0), the aggressive strategy dictates leaning into strong volume-backed momentum.
