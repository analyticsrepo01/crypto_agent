While Williams %R and Stochastic K are in overbought territory, in crypto's trending markets and under an aggressive trading mandate, this often signifies powerful continuation rather than an immediate reversal, especially when coupled with extreme volume and strong MACD signals.

Therefore, the immediate action for the existing position must be HOLD. From a technical perspective, the 5-minute timeframe shows short-term bullish momentum with price above SMAs and a positive MACD crossover. However, this is heavily counterbalanced by extremely overbought conditions across all key momentum indicators: RSI is 90.9, Williams %R is -0.0, and Stochastic K is 100.0. In crypto, RSI > 80 signals are particularly strong for an imminent bearish correction. The AI Trend analysis confirms a BEARISH outlook with MEDIUM confidence and HIGH risk, explicitly citing this overextension as a signal for significant downside risk. The extremely high current volume (21M x average) further indicates significant activity which often precedes corrections at extreme levels. While these underlying technicals would strongly indicate a SELL for a new position due to the high probability of a bearish correction, the existing unprofitable position dictates a HOLD to avoid crystallizing losses and incurring fees, awaiting either a price recovery or a stop-loss trigger.

The current price ($2482.92) is trading above both the 5-minute SMA 20 ($2482.18) and SMA 50 ($2481.88), indicating an uptrend. Momentum indicators Williams %R (-20.1) and Stochastic K (79.9) are in near overbought territory, signaling powerful buying pressure. Crucially, current volume (77,795,975) is orders of magnitude above its moving average (Volume Ratio 716987.99x), strongly confirming heightened interest and validating the bullish move. While the MACD histogram and line suggest a bearish crossover or continuation, the overwhelming strength from volume and momentum, coupled with the AI's BULLISH trend analysis (medium confidence), justifies a BUY. In aggressive mode, priority is given to momentum and volume. The existing position of 0.060413999999999995 shares, currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L $-0.01 after fees), will be held as per mandatory fee-aware sell rules; this BUY action is for adding new shares to capitalize on the strong upward momentum.

The AI trend analysis explicitly warns of a \"consolidation phase with potential for a pullback\" due to these overbought indicators and current price flatness. In aggressive trading mode, it is crucial to maximize profit and accept higher risk, which includes taking decisive action to lock in gains when reversal signals are strong, especially when an explicit pullback warning is present. Selling now capitalizes on existing profits and avoids potential downside from a correction. The aggregated technical score of 3 also falls within the \"actionable for SELL\" range (6 or less).",

As per the mandatory fee-aware sell rules, I MUST recommend HOLD unless a stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here (Gross P&L is $0.00). While the AI trend analysis indicates a BULLISH trend with MEDIUM confidence due to positive momentum and high current volume, it also critically warns that the asset is \"currently overbought as indicated by Bollinger Bands, suggesting a potential short-term correction.\" This overbought condition, combined with a neutral RSI (50.0) and flat MACD (0.000), presents conflicting signals that do not support an aggressive new BUY entry at this moment. The price is above SMA 20 and SMA 50, which is positive, but the warning of an impending correction outweighs the immediate bullish momentum for new entries. Therefore, the primary action is to hold the existing unprofitable position and wait for either a clear price recovery to achieve profitability for a potential sell or a stronger, less ambiguous BUY signal for further accumulation.",
