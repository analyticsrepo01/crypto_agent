Firstly, momentum indicators (RSI 67.2, Williams %R -16.0, Stochastic K 84.0) are all in overbought territory, indicating potential for a short-term pullback, as also noted by the AI Trend Analysis. Buying into an overbought condition goes against the ""prioritize capital preservation"" directive of the balanced mode. Secondly, the crucial 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, preventing the necessary dual-timeframe confirmation for trend alignment and high confidence, which is a key requirement for high-priority trades. Without this, confidence in a strong directional move for entry is reduced. The calculated technical score of 0 reflects the combined cautionary signals outweighing the bullish trend for immediate entry, falling well below the 6+ threshold for a high-priority BUY.
