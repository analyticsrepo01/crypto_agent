Despite the lack of 1-hour data, the 5-minute timeframe shows clear bearish momentum. The MACD has a bearish crossover (MACD Line -0.203 below Signal -0.115), which is a strong sell signal, further reinforced by the AI trend analysis which is BEARISH with MEDIUM confidence. While momentum indicators like Williams %R (-78.6) and Stochastic K (21.4) are oversold, the AI reasoning suggests this indicates underlying weakness in the current upward movement due to previously ""overbought conditions"" (price above upper Bollinger Band, though specific Bollinger Band data isn't provided, this is the AI's interpretation). High current volume (78,417,723) supports a decisive action. In an aggressive mode, taking profit on a turning momentum is critical.",N/A,2485.41,49.998992969999996,sim_1755698872,Submitted,0.020117,0,0,0.000157,0.0,999.99899297,4,

This oversold status, which is a stronger signal in crypto, is coupled with a bullish MACD crossover (MACD Line -0.002 > Signal -0.006) and a positive MACD Histogram (0.004), signaling emerging upward momentum. Critically, current volume is an astounding 35043.84 times the average, indicating massive buying interest or significant market activity that often precedes a strong price move. Despite the current position being unprofitable, the aggressive trading mode and high technical score (7.5) justify an immediate BUY to capitalize on the anticipated upward reversal from these confluence of strong momentum and volume indicators to maximize potential profit and improve the average entry price.",N/A,120.3,,sim_1755698872,Submitted,0.415628,0,0,0.000126,0.0,999.99899297,4,50.0
