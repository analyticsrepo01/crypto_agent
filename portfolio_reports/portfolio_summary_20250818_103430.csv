Beyond this, a ""BALANCED TRADING MODE"" requires strong technical alignment and prioritizes capital preservation. While the news sentiment for META is strongly positive (+0.60) due to strong Q2 earnings and AI-driven ad growth, the technical analysis indicates a **strong established bearish trend (AI Trend: BEARISH, High Confidence)**. The price is below all key moving averages (SMA 20, SMA 50, EMA 12, EMA 26), and there are bearish MA crossovers (SMA20 < SMA50, EMA12 < EMA26). While short-term momentum indicators (RSI 23.9, Williams %R -76.9, Stochastic K 23.1, Stochastic D 26.9) are deeply oversold and MACD shows a nascent bullish crossover, these are counter-trend signals against a powerful underlying downtrend, posing a high risk. The ""BALANCED TRADING MODE"" requires a technical score of 6+ for a high-priority BUY, and META's technical score of 3 is far below this threshold. The strategy also avoids trades during high volatility periods (AI Risk Level: HIGH) and demands multiple confirming indicators for strong technical alignment, which is absent for a BUY here.
