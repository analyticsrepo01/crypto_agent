The current position of 0.00510355 shares exceeds the ""Max shares per stock: 5"" constraint (interpreted as 0.005 units given 0.001 trade size).

The current price ($2482.92) is decisively above both the SMA 20 ($2482.18) and SMA 50 ($2482.08), with a clear bullish crossover (SMA 20 > SMA 50). Momentum indicators are robustly positive: the MACD histogram is positive (0.016) and the MACD line (-0.065) is above its signal line (-0.080), indicating increasing upward pressure. Crucially, volume is extraordinarily high (715,799x average), providing strong confirmation for the price movement and supporting the aggressive trading strategy which prioritizes momentum and volume. The AI trend analysis confidently affirms a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. While the existing position is currently unprofitable to sell ($-0.26 net P&L), the overwhelming bullish signals in this aggressive trading mode dictate adding to the position to average down and maximize potential returns from the anticipated price appreciation. No news sentiment is available to alter this strong technical recommendation.

This strong bearish momentum is further confirmed by exceptionally high volume (34491.38x average). While Williams %R and Stochastic K show oversold conditions, the predominant technical signals point to continued downside pressure, suggesting a strong SELL signal under normal circumstances. However, the current position is unprofitable with a Net P&L of $-0.42 and does not meet the mandatory 2% stop-loss trigger. As per the critical fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position must be held unless it's an emergency stop-loss.

The current price ($577.66) is above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50 ($575.53), further supporting a short-term bullish outlook. The daily change is positive (+0.37%), and the AI trend analysis identifies a BULLISH trend. While the 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, and some 5-minute indicators (RSI at 50.0, MACD at 0.000, nan/0 values for Williams %R, Stochastic K, ATR, and Volatility) are neutral or inconclusive, the overwhelming volume and positive price action are strong enough to warrant a BUY in an aggressive, risk-tolerant strategy.
