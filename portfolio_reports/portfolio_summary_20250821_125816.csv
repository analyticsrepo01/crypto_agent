As per mandatory trading rules, it is currently UNPROFITABLE to sell and does not meet the 2%+ stop-loss trigger. Therefore, the existing position MUST be held. For new trades, the technical picture is mixed. The 5-minute timeframe shows bearish momentum with MACD indicating a downtrend and price trading below both SMA 20 and SMA 50. Crucially, the current price movement is accompanied by an extraordinarily high volume (35154.44x average), which, on a negative daily change, indicates strong selling pressure. While Williams %R and Stochastic K are extremely oversold (-100.0 and 0.0 respectively), suggesting potential for a bounce, the aggressive trading mode prioritizes momentum and volume. The strong bearish volume and MACD configuration currently outweigh the oversold oscillators for initiating a new aggressive BUY, especially without 1-hour data for trend confirmation or positive news. The AI trend analysis also indicates a 'BEARISH' bias, albeit with low confidence.
