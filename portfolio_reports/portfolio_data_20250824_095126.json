This loss does not meet the 2%+ stop-loss trigger. According to mandatory trading rules, an unprofitable position must be held if it has not hit a stop-loss. Therefore, despite any technical leanings, an immediate SELL is not permissible. We await price recovery or a stop-loss trigger.",

Crucially, the current volume is exceptionally high at 77,625,073, far exceeding the Volume MA by a factor of 716475.08x average, which provides strong confirmation for the bullish move. As per aggressive trading mode, we prioritize momentum and volume, both of which are overwhelmingly positive here, and consider technical scores 4+ as actionable for BUY.

Although Williams %R (-96.3) and Stochastic K (3.7) show oversold conditions, the AI's analysis explicitly interprets these as suggesting \"potential for continued upward movement from current levels\" within the established bullish trend. My current position is profitable ($+0.10 net P&L after fees), satisfying the profitability criteria for a hold. As the \"Max shares per stock\" constraint of 5 is already exceeded (current 5.4 shares), I cannot initiate a new BUY order. Given the aggressive trading mode, the strong bullish technical signals (Technical Score 10), and a profitable existing position, holding is the optimal strategy to maximize potential returns without violating constraints.",

As the \"Max shares per stock\" constraint of 5 is already exceeded (current 5.4 shares), I cannot initiate a new BUY order.

Despite these strong bearish technical signals that would normally trigger a SELL in aggressive mode, the current position for BTCUSD is explicitly marked as \"\u274c UNPROFITABLE to sell\" with a net P&L of $-0.76. According to the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, I am prohibited from selling an unprofitable position unless it meets the 2%+ stop-loss trigger. The current loss is significantly less than 2% ($101.04 vs. ~$2156.02).

While 5-minute technicals show some bullish signs (price above SMAs, bullish MACD crossover), these are largely undermined by the AI trend analysis highlighting \"virtually no price movement, extremely low volatility, and mixed momentum signals\" despite extremely high volume. This leads to a \"fragile and uncertain bullish bias\" with LOW confidence and HIGH risk. There is no 1-hour data for trend confirmation. For an aggressive BUY, we require strong, clear momentum and volume with price action, which is absent here. Therefore, the most prudent action is to HOLD the current unprofitable position and await clearer directional signals or price recovery.",

Price is trading above both SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating short-term strength. Momentum indicators, specifically Stochastic K (3.7) and Williams %R (-96.3), are deeply oversold, signaling a strong potential for an upward reversal or continuation, which are powerful buy signals in crypto-adjusted aggressive mode. This is further reinforced by exceptionally high volume (34117.85x average), providing strong confirmation for any upward movement. The AI trend analysis also indicates a \"BULLISH\" trend with \"HIGH\" confidence, citing a reported bullish MACD crossover. Although the current position slightly exceeds the 'Max shares per stock: 5' constraint, the aggressive trading mode prioritizes maximizing profit through decisive action, and selling a highly profitable asset with strong bullish momentum contradicts this objective.

Despite the AI's 'BULLISH' trend assessment, its confidence is LOW and the risk is HIGH. Crucially, there is no 1-hour data for medium-term trend confirmation, and short-term momentum indicators (RSI 50.0, MACD 0.000) are flat or neutral, directly contradicting the aggressive mode's priority on momentum. The absence of historical volatility (ATR 0.000, 20-day Volatility 0.000, Volume MA 0) renders any derived technical strength highly unreliable. The overall technical score, considering the unreliability and lack of clear momentum, falls below the aggressive BUY threshold of 4+, thus no additional shares should be purchased.",

As the \"Max shares per stock\" constraint of 5 is already exceeded (current 5.4 shares), I cannot initiate a new BUY order.
