This strongly suggests a high probability of an imminent bullish rebound, despite the short-term price being below SMAs and a bearish MACD alignment, which contribute to the oversold state. The AI trend analysis also corroborates a bullish rebound prediction with medium confidence. However, due to the critical absence of 1-hour timeframe data, dual-timeframe analysis and alignment cannot be performed. This prevents a high-priority or high-confidence trade as per Balanced Trading Mode requirements, which prioritizes strong technical alignment across timeframes for high-priority actions.
