The Balanced Trading Mode actively prioritizes capital preservation and requires dual-timeframe analysis, weighing the 1-hour trend more heavily for direction and demanding high confidence only when both timeframes agree. The absence of this critical 1-hour data significantly hinders a comprehensive assessment and prevents strong technical alignment across timeframes. Furthermore, short-term momentum indicators (RSI, Williams %R, Stochastic K) are all showing overbought conditions, which, while noted by the AI, introduce a degree of short-term risk for a new long position.
