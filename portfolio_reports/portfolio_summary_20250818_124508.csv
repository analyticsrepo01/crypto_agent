Despite these oversold signals indicating potential for a bounce, the overall bearish trend does not provide the ""strong technical alignment"" required for a BUY in the BALANCED TRADING MODE, which prioritizes capital preservation and steady growth. A counter-trend buy, even based on oversold conditions, carries higher risk than aligning with the dominant trend. The calculated technical score for a BUY (4.5) does not meet the ""6+"" threshold for a high-priority BUY.
