The AI trend analysis confirms a BULLISH outlook with MEDIUM confidence. While momentum indicators like RSI, Stochastic K, and Williams %R are neutral (50.0, -50.0), the price action above key moving averages and the bullish MACD alignment, combined with extremely high current volume (78,407,493), supports the continuation of the short-term upward momentum. In an aggressive trading mode aimed at maximizing profit and accepting higher risk, holding a profitable position with a bullish technical bias is preferred over taking a small profit, especially when there are no immediate bearish signals (like negative news or significant technical breakdowns) that would trigger an immediate sell according to aggressive sell rules (technical score 6- or negative news trigger).",6.0,MEDIUM,BULLISH,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,50.0,107764.706,107771.1752,1.8499582244015604,0.0,31623465.50354279,AGGRESSIVE
