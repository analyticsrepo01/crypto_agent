The AI Trend Analysis confirms a ""BULLISH"" outlook. Crucially, current volume is exceptionally high (78,666,103, 31 million times the average), which, combined with the price holding above key moving averages despite a negligible daily change, suggests strong underlying buying pressure and potential for upward momentum.
