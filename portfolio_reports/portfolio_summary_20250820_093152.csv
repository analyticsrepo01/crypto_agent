The current price of $107700.02 is trading significantly above both the 5-minute SMA 20 ($105257.21) and SMA 50 ($106697.02), indicating robust short-term upward pressure. Volume is exceptionally high at 78,203,331, registering a Volume Ratio of over 15.7 million times the average, which strongly confirms intense buying interest and supports a continued upward move. While the 5-minute MACD remains bearish, momentum oscillators such as Stochastic K (17.4) and Williams %R (-82.6) are deeply oversold, signaling a high probability of an immediate bullish rebound within the prevailing uptrend. The AI trend analysis corroborates a 'BULLISH' trend, noting the significant price increase, high volume, and oversold indicators. In aggressive trading mode, momentum and volume are prioritized. Despite the absence of 1-hour data, the overwhelming bullish signals from price action, volume, and the potential for an oversold bounce on the 5-minute timeframe justify an aggressive BUY.
