This is further confirmed by a strongly negative MACD histogram (-2.244) and a BEARISH AI Trend with HIGH confidence. Although the AI Trend indicates HIGH risk, for a SELL, this aligns with a potential for significant downside, and the overall technical confidence is high (not low as in the previously rejected AAPL case). All key bearish signals align, and there is no news sentiment to counteract the strong technical outlook. Current shares (12) allow for a 10-share SELL order.",N/A,1213.4,12134.0,384,Filled,10.0,0.0,1213.5,1.237738,999575.05,1001497.72,1
