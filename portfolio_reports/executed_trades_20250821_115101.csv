While momentum indicators like Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are extremely oversold, the complete lack of price movement makes them unreliable for predicting an immediate bounce. Furthermore, the MACD line has crossed below its signal line, indicating bearish momentum. As an aggressive trader with a currently profitable position ($+0.21 Net P&L), it is prudent to secure profits and free up capital from a non-moving asset rather than waiting for an unconfirmed future trend, especially when no strong bullish signals are actively driving price. The aggressive trading mode prioritizes decisive action to maximize profit.",N/A,107807.83,50.0001934757,sim_1755791439,Submitted,0.00046379,0,0,0.00015,2025-08-21,0.0,1050.0001934757,3
