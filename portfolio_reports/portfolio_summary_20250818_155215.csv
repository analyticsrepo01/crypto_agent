Although some oscillators like RSI and Stochastic are currently neutral, the confirmation from MACD and the AI's comprehensive technical assessment provides sufficient bearish alignment.

The AI analysis explicitly highlights these overbought conditions and warns of a ""potential for a short-term pullback"" with a ""HIGH"" risk level. The price is also nearing the Upper Bollinger Band, suggesting potential resistance. Given the ""BALANCED TRADING MODE"" which prioritizes capital preservation, demands multiple confirming indicators, and avoids trades during high volatility/risk, initiating a BUY position at a high risk level with clear overbought signals is not prudent.

The AI Trend Analysis explicitly states the ""uptrend is overextended and vulnerable to a short-term pullback"" due to these overbought indicators and detected negative volume movement. While moving averages and MACD show a bullish trend, the confluence of overbought signals from multiple confirming indicators strongly suggests a high probability of a price correction.
