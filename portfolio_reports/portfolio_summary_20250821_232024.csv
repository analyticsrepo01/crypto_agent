This is strongly reinforced by the AI's BEARISH trend assessment (MEDIUM confidence) and the observation of high volume accompanying negative price movement. As an aggressive trader in an active trading mode, entering a long position against such clear and comprehensive bearish signals would expose the portfolio to unnecessary risk and is counter to the objective of maximizing profit. Since there is no current position, a SELL action is not possible. Therefore, the decisive action is to HOLD, avoiding entry into a declining asset, and await a clear bullish reversal or a viable shorting opportunity.

While indicators like Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are approaching or within overbought territory, and the AI reasoning warns of a ""potential short-term pullback,"" aggressive trading mode accepts higher risk for higher potential returns and prioritizes strong momentum and volume for decisive action. The current technical strength (score 10) significantly exceeds the aggressive BUY threshold of 4+.
