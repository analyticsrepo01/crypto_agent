Despite lagging bearish signals from MACD, all key momentum oscillators (RSI at 26.5, Williams %R at -72.6, Stochastic K at 27.4) are deeply oversold, signaling a high probability of an imminent bounce, which is a prime opportunity for an aggressive BUY. The current price is also trading above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50. Given the ""AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE"" and prioritization of momentum/volume, these oversold conditions combined with strong overall price action and volume provide a high-conviction buy signal to capitalize on the expected bounce.
