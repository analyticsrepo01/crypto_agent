The AI Trend Analysis confirms a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence, citing price below key moving averages and negative price movement confirmed by high volume.

RSI (50.0), Williams %R (-40.1), and Stochastic K (59.9) are all neutral. The extremely high volume (712254.52x average) indicates significant activity, which, combined with the slight price decline and bearish MAs, suggests selling pressure.
