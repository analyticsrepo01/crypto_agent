      "reasoning": "All critical 5-minute technical indicators (MACD bearish crossover with a negative histogram, price trading significantly below both 20-period and 50-period SMAs) point to a strong bearish trend and downward momentum. This is strongly reinforced by the AI's BEARISH trend assessment (MEDIUM confidence) and the observation of high volume accompanying negative price movement. As an aggressive trader in an active trading mode, entering a long position against such clear and comprehensive bearish signals would expose the portfolio to unnecessary risk and is counter to the objective of maximizing profit. Since there is no current position, a SELL action is not possible. Therefore, the decisive action is to HOLD, avoiding entry into a declining asset, and await a clear bullish reversal or a viable shorting opportunity. No news data is available to influence the decision.",

Crucially, the Current Volume (77,022,181) is exceptionally high with a Volume Ratio of 702794.72x average, providing strong confirmation of the bullish price movement. The AI Trend Analysis categorizes the trend as BULLISH with HIGH confidence, indicating a broader uptrend. While indicators like Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are approaching or within overbought territory, and the AI reasoning warns of a \"potential short-term pullback,\" aggressive trading mode accepts higher risk for higher potential returns and prioritizes strong momentum and volume for decisive action. The current technical strength (score 10) significantly exceeds the aggressive BUY threshold of 4+. The existing position, currently at a net P&L of $0.00, is unprofitable to sell per mandatory rules and thus remains a HOLD; however, new BUY action is warranted by the strong underlying bullish signals.",

All technical indicators, including RSI (50.0), MACD (0.000), and SMAs (20/50 at $18.82), are perfectly neutral, indicating a total absence of momentum or trend. Crucially, the vital 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, preventing any confirmation of a medium-term trend, which is a key component for higher-conviction decisions in aggressive mode. While current volume is high, the Volume MA is reported as 0, rendering the volume ratio unreliable. The AI trend analysis accurately identifies a NEUTRAL trend with HIGH confidence and LOW risk. Given the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE's emphasis on momentum and decisive action, the complete lack of any directional signal or momentum, coupled with the absence of critical 1-hour data, means there is no actionable BUY or SELL opportunity at this time. We must await a clear trend or significant price movement before considering an entry.",

Furthermore, momentum oscillators Williams %R (-95.8) and Stochastic K (4.2) are in extremely oversold territory, which in crypto often suggests a high probability of an upward reversal, aligning with the overall bullish trend. Critically, current volume is extraordinarily high (34620.65x average), providing strong confirmation for the observed price action and potential trend continuation. The AI trend analysis also corroborates a HIGH confidence BULLISH outlook. Despite the existing small position being currently unprofitable to sell due to fees, the overwhelming bullish technical signals and aggressive trading mode mandate a BUY action to capitalize on the anticipated upward movement.",

While the 5-minute timeframe shows a weak bullish trend (positive price movement, price above SMAs, and extremely high volume indicating momentum), the AI trend analysis explicitly warns of an overbought condition and a potential near-term correction. This mixed technical outlook, combining weak bullish momentum with an overbought warning, reinforces the decision to hold the current position rather than selling at a loss or initiating a new trade, waiting for the price to recover to a profitable level.",

Furthermore, all available technical indicators on the 5-minute timeframe (RSI, MACD, SMAs) show extreme consolidation and neutrality, with zero volatility (ATR, 20-day Volatility) despite high current volume.

As an aggressive trader in an active trading mode, entering a long position against such clear and comprehensive bearish signals would expose the portfolio to unnecessary risk and is counter to the objective of maximizing profit. Since there is no current position, a SELL action is not possible. Therefore, the decisive action is to HOLD, avoiding entry into a declining asset, and await a clear bullish reversal or a viable shorting opportunity.

The AI Trend Analysis categorizes the trend as BULLISH with HIGH confidence, indicating a broader uptrend. While indicators like Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are approaching or within overbought territory, and the AI reasoning warns of a \"potential short-term pullback,\" aggressive trading mode accepts higher risk for higher potential returns and prioritizes strong momentum and volume for decisive action. The current technical strength (score 10) significantly exceeds the aggressive BUY threshold of 4+. The existing position, currently at a net P&L of $0.00, is unprofitable to sell per mandatory rules and thus remains a HOLD; however, new BUY action is warranted by the strong underlying bullish signals.",

Crucially, the vital 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, preventing any confirmation of a medium-term trend, which is a key component for higher-conviction decisions in aggressive mode. While current volume is high, the Volume MA is reported as 0, rendering the volume ratio unreliable. The AI trend analysis accurately identifies a NEUTRAL trend with HIGH confidence and LOW risk. Given the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE's emphasis on momentum and decisive action, the complete lack of any directional signal or momentum, coupled with the absence of critical 1-hour data, means there is no actionable BUY or SELL opportunity at this time.

The AI Trend Analysis corroborates a BEARISH trend, albeit with LOW confidence, citing the bearish alignment of MACD and moving averages. The RSI and Stochastic K are neutral, failing to provide strong directional signals. Current volume is high, but without clear confirmation of buying pressure, it does not override the existing bearish technicals. Given the aggressive trading mode requiring technical scores 4+ for a BUY, and the prevalent short-term bearish signals (MACD, SMAs) indicating a bullish score well below this threshold, there is no actionable BUY signal. As there is no current position, a SELL action is not applicable. Therefore, the recommendation is to HOLD and wait for clearer bullish momentum or 1-hour data for trend confirmation.",

Critically, the current volume of 77,070,070 is an astronomical 711889.53x the average volume, providing exceptionally strong confirmation for the bullish price movement. The AI Trend Analysis also confirms a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence.

Critically, the current volume is extraordinarily high (34484.88x average), signaling significant market interest and potential for a strong momentum-driven move upwards. While 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, the confluence of extreme short-term oversold conditions and massive volume provides high conviction for a decisive BUY.

There is no 1-hour timeframe data available, directly contravening the instruction to weigh 1-hour trends more heavily for direction. While the 5-minute timeframe shows price above SMAs and high current volume, momentum oscillators like RSI (50.0) and MACD (0.000) are neutral.

Furthermore, the technical analysis for ZECUSD is highly ambiguous and compromised by widespread data inconsistencies (zero volatility, flat MACD, neutral RSI). While there's a slight positive daily change and extremely high current volume, the AI trend analysis indicates low confidence, a \"BULLISH\" trend but simultaneously \"overbought,\" and deems market conditions \"extremely ambiguous.\" With no 1-hour data available, short-term 5-minute indicators are mixed and lack strong conviction in either direction.

Both Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are in the overbought territory, signaling a high probability of a downward price reversal, which are particularly strong signals in crypto markets. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence, specifically noting the price below key moving averages, negative daily change (-0.10%), and inferred high selling volume. While the MACD shows a bullish crossover (Line > Signal) and positive histogram, this is strongly counteracted by the overwhelming bearish signals from price action, momentum oscillators, and the overall AI trend. The extremely high current volume (31,359,568.49x average) suggests conviction behind the current price movement, likely fueling selling pressure as indicated by the AI. Given the aggressive mode's emphasis on momentum and quick action, we prioritize the strong bearish confluence despite the conflicting MACD.

Robust momentum indicators, including Stochastic K at 79.9 and Williams %R at -20.1, confirm strong upward pressure, albeit nearing overbought conditions which aggressive traders can leverage. This bullish price action is powerfully supported by an exceptionally high volume ratio (708077.03x average), indicating significant market interest and confirmation of the upward trend. While the absence of 1-hour data limits comprehensive dual timeframe analysis, leading to a medium confidence level, and the AI notes \"HIGH\" risk with caveats regarding \"negative OBV\" and \"anomalous zero values,\" the immediate short-term momentum and volume are compelling. Under AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, which prioritizes momentum and volume indicators for decisive action and accepts higher risk, a BUY signal is actionable. The existing position is currently unprofitable (Net P&L: $-0.06) and falls under the mandatory 'UNPROFITABLE to sell' rule, thus requiring a HOLD for those shares.

The absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and confirmation of the medium-term trend, increasing uncertainty. Given the aggressive trading mode requires clear technical scores (4+ for BUY, 6- for SELL) for actionable decisions, the mixed signals do not meet these thresholds for a new aggressive entry.

The AI trend analysis, while identifying a BULLISH trend, assigns LOW confidence and HIGH risk, and critically mentions a \"significantly overbought\" condition (despite RSI being neutral), which suggests caution and potential for a short-term correction.

Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are in overbought regions, indicating a strong likelihood of a short-term price correction downwards. Given these predominantly bearish and reversal-signaling indicators, a BUY is not warranted as the technical score does not meet the 4+ threshold.

An exceptionally high Volume Ratio (34415.72x average) highlights significant buying interest and potential for a sharp price movement, aligning with a momentum-driven strategy. While the price is currently below the SMA 20 and SMA 50, this is common during the initial phases of an oversold bounce.

While current volume is exceptionally high, indicating momentum, the AI analysis explicitly warns that the price is \"overbought\" and suggests a \"potential near-term correction\" despite a nominal \"BULLISH\" trend label, which is also described as having \"weak bullish strength.\" RSI (50.0) and MACD (0.000) are neutral. Aggressive mode prioritizes maximizing profit and being quick to enter/exit. Entering a new long position on an asset identified as 'overbought' with a 'potential near-term correction' would be counter to maximizing profit, as immediate downside risk is high. While a short trade might be considered aggressively due to the overbought status, the AI still labels the overall trend as BULLISH, albeit weak. Without stronger confirmation of a reversal or a clear breakdown, the conflicting signals and strong cautionary warnings from the AI analysis make a new aggressive BUY too risky for immediate profit maximization, and a new SELL (short) too speculative against a lingering, albeit weak, bullish trend. Therefore, the prudent action is to HOLD, waiting for clearer directional signals or a confirmed correction.",

The current price of $107700.02 is trading below both the 20-period ($107759.32) and 50-period ($107766.86) Simple Moving Averages, confirming short-term bearish momentum. The MACD histogram is negative (-2.811), and the MACD line (-7.770) is below its signal line (-4.959), reinforcing the bearish outlook. While Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) indicate short-term overbought conditions, in the context of a confirmed bearish trend and high volume, these are more likely to signify a temporary peak or exhaustion of a bounce within the downtrend rather than a strong reversal or BUY signal. Volume is exceptionally high (78,605,100, with a 31400696.86x average volume ratio), confirming strong conviction behind the current market movement, which is bearish. The AI trend analysis aligns with this, identifying a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence. Given the aggressive trading mode, while we accept higher risk, there are no strong technical signals (score 4+) to justify a BUY action. The overall technical setup suggests continued bearish pressure or at best a temporary consolidation before a potential further move lower. Therefore, with no current position, the prudent action is to HOLD and await clearer bullish reversal signals.",

The technical analysis for ETHUSD is overwhelmingly bullish on the 5-minute timeframe, supported by extremely high volume. The price ($2482.92) is significantly above both SMA 20 ($2481.93) and SMA 50 ($2481.88), indicating a strong upward trend. MACD Histogram is positive (0.021), and the MACD Line (-0.001) is on the verge of a bullish crossover above the Signal Line (-0.022), which the AI already identifies as a \"strong bullish MACD crossover.\" Both Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) show robust upward momentum, approaching overbought conditions but not yet at extreme crypto levels (>80 or <-80). Crucially, the Current Volume (76,919,218) with a Volume Ratio of 707343.24x average indicates immense buying pressure and confirms the robust upward momentum, a key priority for aggressive trading. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, labeling the trend as BULLISH with HIGH Confidence. With no negative news to counteract, and a technical score of 10, the strategy is to add to the existing position to capitalize on the strong bullish momentum and aim for an overall profitable exit. The existing position's unprofitability for selling currently prevents an exit but does not preclude aggressive re-entry/averaging into a strongly bullish market.",

Additionally, many key technical indicators (Williams %R, Stochastic K, ATR, 20-day Volatility) are anomalous or missing, severely limiting the reliability of the analysis.

The MACD shows a strong bearish crossover (MACD Line at -10.861 is below the Signal Line at -1.810), with a negative and decreasing histogram, indicating strong downward momentum. Furthermore, the current price ($107700.02) is below both the 5-minute SMA 20 ($107770.10) and SMA 50 ($107769.02), confirming short-term bearish pressure. The AI Trend Analysis explicitly identifies a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence and HIGH risk, reinforcing the negative outlook. With no current position, and clear bearish signals, entering a BUY trade would be against risk management principles even in an aggressive strategy. Therefore, the prudent action is to HOLD and avoid opening a long position in a bearish market. No news data is available to influence this technical assessment.",

MACD shows robust bullish momentum with a positive histogram (0.018) and the MACD line (0.010) above the signal line (-0.008), confirming a strong buy signal. Momentum indicators like Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are showing intense buying pressure, on the cusp of overbought, which for aggressive crypto trading, signals strong upward drive. Crucially, volume is exceptionally high (77,064,144, a 706065.75x ratio above average) on a positive price day (+0.10% daily change), providing strong confirmation for the bullish trend.

The current volume of 32,130,795 is an extraordinary 34636.97x its average, signaling intense market interest and potential for an immediate breakout, a key driver in aggressive trading. Both Williams %R (-95.8) and Stochastic K (4.2) are in extremely oversold territory, strongly indicating a potential bounce or reversal upwards. The MACD histogram (0.006) is positive, and the MACD line (0.005) is above its signal line (-0.001), confirming increasing bullish momentum. While the AI trend analysis has LOW confidence due to \"extreme price stagnation,\" the current explosive volume combined with oversold conditions suggests this stagnation could be about to break. No 1-hour data is available, so the decision is based on strong 5-minute signals, prioritizing momentum and volume as per aggressive trading rules.

According to the Critical Fee-Aware Sell Rules, an \"UNPROFITABLE to sell\" status mandates a HOLD unless a stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here. Short-term (5-minute) technical analysis shows some bullish momentum: the price ($577.66) is above both SMA 20 ($575.53) and SMA 50 ($575.53), the daily change is positive (+0.37%), and current volume is significant (5,000,000). The AI trend analysis also identifies a BULLISH trend with MEDIUM confidence, attributing it to price above MAs and high volume. However, key oscillators like RSI (50.0) and MACD (0.000) are neutral, indicating a lack of strong, confirmed momentum. Crucially, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and confirmation of a sustained medium-term trend, which is a significant detractor for high-conviction aggressive trades. Although the calculated technical score of 5.0 meets the \"actionable for BUY\" threshold (4+), the mandatory hold on the existing unprofitable position, combined with the lack of medium-term trend confirmation and mixed short-term signals (AI warning of \"overbought conditions\" despite neutral RSI), suggests it is more prudent to HOLD. This action allows the existing position to potentially recover into profitability while awaiting clearer, more aligned signals before considering further aggressive action.",

Furthermore, the ATR and 20-day Volatility are both 0.000, indicating a lack of significant price movement despite the volume. The AI trend analysis, while \"BULLISH\" with \"MEDIUM\" confidence, specifically mentions \"weak bullish momentum\" and \"overbought conditions\" (despite RSI being neutral), which contradicts a strong aggressive BUY signal. The combined technical score is below the aggressive BUY threshold of 4, primarily due to the neutral momentum and the highly concerning zero volatility data.

While momentum indicators like MACD (positive histogram, line above signal), Williams %R (-20.0), and Stochastic K (80.0) show strong bullish momentum and are in overbought territory, this strength is failing to push the price above key short-term moving averages.

Furthermore, the historical context shows strong recent selling activity for BTCUSD (\"last: SELL\", \"Today's Trades: 9 Sells, 0 Buys\").

Further confirmation comes from a bullish MACD crossover (MACD Line -0.002 > MACD Signal -0.005, with a positive Histogram of 0.003). Crucially, the current volume is an astonishing 34644.30x its average, signifying a massive surge in market activity that often accompanies significant price reversals from oversold levels. While the price is currently below short-term SMAs, and the AI notes a neutral trend, the prioritized momentum and volume signals for an aggressive strategy strongly point to a short-term bounce or reversal.

Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents proper dual timeframe analysis and significantly reduces confidence in any sustained trend. Additionally, other critical volatility indicators like ATR and 20-day Volatility are zero, which is inconsistent with the reported positive daily change and high volume, suggesting incomplete or conflicting data. The AI also flags the asset as potentially overbought by Bollinger Bands and assigns a LOW confidence to its BULLISH trend due to these conflicting signals and missing data. The calculated technical score of +1 is well below the '4+' threshold required for an aggressive BUY action.

Furthermore, all 5-minute technical indicators (RSI 50.0, MACD values at 0.000, SMAs at $0.15, ATR 0.000, and 20-day Volatility 0.000) indicate extreme price consolidation with no discernible trend or momentum. The AI's assessment of \"LOW Confidence\" and \"HIGH Risk\" due to contradictions with raw data is accurate. 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, preventing medium-term trend confirmation. Volume data is anomalous (5,000,000 current with 0 MA), making it an unreliable momentum indicator. There are no clear BUY or SELL signals, and no news sentiment to influence the decision.

While current volume is 5,000,000, the Volume MA is 0, making the volume ratio misleading and indicating potentially unreliable volume data or extreme illiquidity prior to this moment. The AI Trend Analysis confirms a \"NEUTRAL\" trend with \"HIGH\" confidence due to \"extreme stagnation.\" Crucially, there is no 1-hour data available for medium-term trend confirmation, a critical directive.

The absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents confirmation of a broader bullish trend, which is crucial for a confident BUY decision in aggressive trading.

Furthermore, ATR and 20-day volatility are both 0.000, indicating a complete absence of price movement.

The AI Trend Analysis confirms a BULLISH trend with MEDIUM confidence, citing price above key moving averages and high volume.

Furthermore, current volume is astronomically high relative to its moving average, suggesting significant activity, yet there's no corresponding price movement. The AI trend analysis aligns with a 'BEARISH' outlook but explicitly states 'LOW CONFIDENCE' due to these very contradictions and flatness.

The price ($120.42) is trading above both the 20-period ($120.34) and 50-period ($120.36) Simple Moving Averages, indicating strong short-term upward momentum. Critically, momentum oscillators Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are deep in oversold territory, which in the crypto context are powerful indicators of an imminent bullish reversal. This is further amplified by an astronomical Current Volume of 32,128,810, representing a Volume Ratio of 34631.40x average, signaling massive buying interest and strong momentum, which is a key priority for aggressive trading. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, identifying a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. While 1-hour data is unavailable, the robust 5-minute technicals, combined with extreme volume and the aggressive trading mandate, provide sufficient justification for an immediate BUY.

However, the current volume is exceptionally high (5,000,000, which is 5,000,000x the average), signaling significant market interest and potential for future movement, which aligns with aggressive trading's focus on momentum. The AI Trend Analysis identifies a \"BULLISH\" trend with medium confidence, but critically notes the price is \"above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating an overbought condition and potential for a pullback.\" Without 1-hour timeframe data for trend confirmation and given the conflicting signals (high volume vs. overbought warning and neutral core indicators), coupled with the unprofitable state of the existing position, holding is the most prudent action to await clearer, profitable exit conditions or stronger confirmed bullish momentum that overcomes the overbought state.",

Volatility metrics (ATR and 20-day Volatility) are zero, further indicating a complete lack of price movement. While current volume is notably high (5,000,000) compared to a zero Volume MA, this activity has not translated into any price action, negating its potential as a directional momentum indicator. Crucially, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and the confirmation of any medium-term trend, which is a critical component for high-confidence decisions. The AI Trend Analysis explicitly corroborates this, labeling the trend as \"NEUTRAL\" with \"HIGH\" confidence in this neutrality. In an aggressive trading mode that prioritizes strong momentum and decisive action based on clear signals, entering a completely stagnant market with no discernible trend or price movement would be purely speculative, does not align with maximizing profit through quick action, and presents no actionable technical signals (technical score 0, far below the 4+ for BUY or 6- for SELL thresholds).

However, the critical lack of any price movement (0.00% daily change, zero standard deviation, ADX 0.0) means there is no actionable trend or volatility to leverage for profit maximization, even under an aggressive trading strategy.

This combination strongly suggests significant underlying bullish strength and market interest, aligning with the aggressive strategy to prioritize momentum and volume for profit maximization. The extreme volume indicates a strong buy-side presence that an aggressive trader would look to capitalize on.

The current price ($120.42) is above both SMA 20 ($120.34) and SMA 50 ($120.36), indicating short-term bullish momentum. Furthermore, an exceptionally high Volume Ratio (34744.94x average) confirms significant market interest and momentum, likely preceding a breakout from the noted \"extreme consolidation.\" The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, predicting a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence and signaling an impending upward move from current support.

Therefore, the mandatory action is to HOLD this position.

The current technical strength (score 10) significantly exceeds the aggressive BUY threshold of 4+.
