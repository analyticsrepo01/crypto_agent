The current price ($107807.83) is significantly above both the 20-period ($107743.14) and 50-period ($107745.30) SMAs, indicating a robust upward trend. MACD shows strong bullish momentum with a positive histogram (4.151) and the MACD line (1.840) above the signal line (-2.311). Crucially, volume is extremely high (77,727,896) with a massive volume ratio (30988769.73x average), providing strong confirmation for the price movement. The RSI (55.6) is healthy, suggesting room for further gains without being overbought.
