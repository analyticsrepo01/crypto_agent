The news sentiment is NEUTRAL (score: -0.20), which aligns with avoiding a BUY recommendation based on strategy rules (""Avoid BUY on negative news (sentiment < -0.2)""). Given the ""BALANCED TRADING MODE"" prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators for trades, the weak technical score (2) falls well below the required 6+ for a high-priority BUY and the neutral-to-negative news further negates any BUY consideration. Furthermore, current portfolio constraints (available cash $85.19, min cash reserve $90, current price $230.72) prevent any BUY action, and with 0 shares currently held, a SELL action is not possible.
