Given the ""BALANCED TRADING MODE"" which prioritizes capital preservation and avoids trades during high volatility or at potentially risky entry points (like an overbought market), initiating a new BUY order is not advisable despite the underlying bullish trend.

Under the BALANCED TRADING MODE, a key directive is to ""avoid trades during high volatility periods"" and ""focus on strong technical alignment.""
