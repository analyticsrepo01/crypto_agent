The On-Balance Volume (OBV) is also negative, suggesting distribution and continued selling pressure. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, classifying the trend as 'BEARISH' with 'HIGH' confidence and 'HIGH' risk, noting that despite some momentum oscillators (Williams %R, Stochastic K/D) showing oversold conditions, the overall technical analysis points to continued downside pressure. This robust alignment of multiple bearish indicators results in a very low technical score (2), which would typically trigger a high-priority SELL under our strategy. However, a BUY action is not feasible due to insufficient available cash ($207.28 vs. $1238.52 per share). A SELL action is also not possible as we currently hold 0 shares of NFLX.
