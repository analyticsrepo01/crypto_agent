Technically, the 5-minute timeframe presents mixed signals with a neutral overall trend. While MACD shows a bullish signal (MACD Line > Signal Line), momentum oscillators (RSI, Stochastic, Williams %R) are perfectly neutral at 50.0. Crucially, the current price ($107700.02) is below both the 5-minute SMA 20 ($107775.49) and SMA 50 ($107762.55), indicating short-term bearish pressure. The AI trend analysis confirms a NEUTRAL trend with MEDIUM confidence, highlighting that ""price remains below key moving averages, and bearish pressure is confirmed by high volume on negative price movement"". The extremely high volume (31179514.63x average) is associated with this negative price action, further dampening bullish prospects. Given the lack of 1-hour data for medium-term trend confirmation, the current technical setup does not provide a strong enough BUY signal (technical score < 4) nor does it trigger a stop-loss for the existing position. Therefore, the most prudent action is to HOLD the existing shares and await clearer directional cues or price recovery.",2.0,MEDIUM,NEUTRAL,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,50.0,107775.48800000001,107762.5504,3.908546750503948,-0.10000201284080912,31179514.63263222,AGGRESSIVE

As per the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, an unprofitable position that is not at its stop-loss trigger must be held. The underlying technical analysis, if considering new trades, points to a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence (AI analysis), supported by the current price ($2480.44) trading below both the SMA 20 ($2482.43) and SMA 50 ($2482.33). Furthermore, the AI reasoning highlights high volume on negative price movement and a negative OBV, indicating prevailing selling pressure.

A massive volume spike (33747.48x average) suggests significant activity, but the immediate momentum indicators point to downside.
