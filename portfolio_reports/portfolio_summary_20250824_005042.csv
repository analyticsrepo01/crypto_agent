Crucially, volume is exceptionally high (Volume Ratio: 30794142.88x average) supporting positive price movement, which is a key priority in aggressive trading. The AI Trend Analysis confirms a BULLISH trend with MEDIUM confidence. While there's a minor bearish MACD crossover, it is significantly outweighed by the robust price action, strong volume, and bullish trend confirmation. As an aggressive trader aiming to maximize profit, acting on these strong momentum signals is paramount.

The MACD shows a clear bullish crossover with a positive histogram, and the price is firmly trading above both the SMA 20 ($2481.43) and SMA 50 ($2481.73), indicating a robust short-term uptrend. Momentum indicators like Williams %R (-20.1) and Stochastic K (79.9) are showing strong buying pressure, although not yet at extreme overbought levels for crypto, suggesting further upside potential. Crucially, the current volume is exceptionally high (710123.58x average), confirming the strength and conviction behind this upward movement. The AI trend analysis also confirms a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. Given the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE and the directive to MAXIMIZE PROFIT by accepting higher risk, adding to the current profitable position to capitalize on this strong momentum is warranted.

While the MACD histogram is slightly positive (0.001), the MACD line (-0.001) and signal (-0.003) are negative, and the overall picture, including the AI trend's reasoning, points to a strong downside risk. An extremely high volume ratio (34175.58x) with flat price action could indicate distribution or an impending significant move, which given the overbought momentum, is more likely to be to the downside.
