The price ($107807.83) is firmly above both the SMA 20 ($107753.93) and SMA 50 ($107766.86), indicating a clear short-term uptrend. Momentum indicators are overwhelmingly positive: MACD shows strong bullish momentum with a positive histogram (5.007) and its line (1.381) well above the signal (-3.626), confirming a sustained bullish crossover. Williams %R at -20.0 and Stochastic K at 80.0 are both at strong bullish levels, indicating intense buying pressure and nearing overbought conditions which, in crypto, often signal continued trend strength rather than reversal. Most critically, the current volume is an astronomical 31,399,491.99x the average volume, indicating an incredibly strong conviction and surge in buying interest behind this price movement. The AI trend analysis also confirms a ""BULLISH"" trend with ""HIGH"" confidence.

With an RSI of 50.0, there is no strong momentum signal.
