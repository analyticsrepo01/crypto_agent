For potential new trades, the technical signals are highly conflicting. While MACD shows bullish momentum with its positive histogram and line above the signal, this is strongly countered by several bearish indicators. The price is trading below both SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating short-term bearish pressure. Stochastic K (80.0) and Williams %R (-20.0) are in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback. Most critically, the AI trend analysis highlights ""high volume on negative movement"" and ""negative On-Balance Volume (OBV)"", indicating that the significant volume is associated with selling pressure, which is a strong bearish confirmation. The overall AI trend is NEUTRAL with LOW confidence and HIGH risk. Given the lack of 1-hour data for medium-term trend confirmation and the aggressive mode's emphasis on momentum and volume (which are bearishly interpreted by the AI), initiating a new BUY position is not advisable despite the MACD signal. Therefore, the recommendation for BTCUSD is to HOLD the existing position and avoid opening new ones until clearer, bullish signals emerge.",2.0,LOW,NEUTRAL,LOW,HIGH,50.0,107770.098,107766.86300000001,0.6673126908262237,-0.10000201284080912,31024907.357935194,AGGRESSIVE

The price is trading below both the SMA 20 ($2482.80) and SMA 50 ($2482.23), confirming a downtrend. A clear bearish MACD cross is present with a negative MACD histogram (-0.128) and the MACD line (-0.029) is below its signal line (0.098), signalling strong downward momentum. This bearish movement is further reinforced by an extremely high volume ratio (715990.24x average), indicating significant selling pressure. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, assigning a HIGH confidence BEARISH trend, citing the price below key moving averages, bearish MACD, and negative price movement confirmed by high volume. While the Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are near overbought levels, suggesting potential for a minor bounce or exhaustion within the short-term, the overall trend is decisively bearish.",5.0,LOW,BEARISH,HIGH,MEDIUM,50.0,2482.7980000000002,2482.2268000000004,-0.12761820677819313,-0.10028474423361843,715990.2406653719,AGGRESSIVE

Price is trading above both SMA 20 ($120.35) and SMA 50 ($120.36), supported by a positive MACD histogram (0.004) and a bullish MACD line positioning above its signal. Crucially, volume is exceptionally high (33864.45x average), confirming strong upward momentum. While Williams %R (-96.2) and Stochastic K (3.8) are in oversold territory, the AI trend analysis explicitly interprets these as signals for ""strong potential for continued upward momentum"" in this bullish context, aligning with aggressive trading principles to buy/hold into strength. The ""Max shares per stock: 5"" constraint means I cannot initiate a new BUY order as the current position (5.4015 shares) exceeds this limit. Given the strong bullish technicals and the mandate to MAXIMIZE PROFIT in an AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, holding the existing profitable position is the optimal strategy to capitalize on anticipated further gains, rather than selling into strength due to a constraint on new buys.",7.0,HIGH,BULLISH,HIGH,MEDIUM,54.54545454545455,120.348,120.3576,0.004154829092017844,0.0997506234414003,33864.445250743294,AGGRESSIVE

The RSI is neutral at 50.0. Critically, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and robust trend confirmation, reducing confidence for aggressive new entries.
