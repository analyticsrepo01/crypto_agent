As per critical fee-aware sell rule #4, the existing position MUST be held unless a stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here. For new trading opportunities, the technical signals on the 5-minute timeframe are conflicting. Price is currently above both the SMA 20 ($107764.71) and SMA 50 ($107771.18), with a positive daily change of +0.10%, which are bullish short-term indicators. Furthermore, the Current Volume is exceptionally high at 78,096,352, with a Volume Ratio of 31461203.63x average, indicating significant market activity. However, the MACD Histogram (-10.226) and MACD Line are below the Signal Line, indicating bearish momentum. Oscillators like RSI (50.0), Williams %R (-40.0), and Stochastic K (60.0) are all in neutral territory. The AI trend analysis explicitly states a 'NEUTRAL' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence and 'HIGH' risk, directly citing these ""conflicting signals and a lack of clear direction."" Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of any sustained medium-term trend and reduces overall confidence, as per the dual timeframe instruction to weight 1-hour trends more heavily. Given the aggressive trading mode prioritizes momentum and volume, the conflict between high volume (suggesting potential movement) and bearish MACD (suggesting downward momentum) combined with neutral oscillators and AI's neutral trend means there is no sufficiently strong and confirmed directional signal (neither 4+ for BUY nor 6- for SELL) to justify initiating a new aggressive trade at this time. Therefore, the recommendation is to HOLD the existing position and await clearer directional signals before considering new entries.",5.0,MEDIUM,NEUTRAL,MEDIUM,HIGH,50.0,107764.70700000001,107771.1756,-10.226409422602428,0.10010211697267805,31461203.626207575,AGGRESSIVE

As per mandatory trading rules, an unprofitable position must be HELD unless a stop-loss is hit. Supporting this, the AI Trend Analysis indicates a NEUTRAL trend with HIGH confidence due to an extremely flat market (0.00% daily change, zero ADX). While the 5-minute MACD shows a bullish crossover and current volume is exceptionally high (708055.89x average), these are contradicted by the price trading below both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, and both Stochastic K (80.0) and Williams %R (-20.0) indicating overbought conditions.

Despite an aggressive trading mode, entering a position when a pullback is anticipated due to an overbought condition poses high risk and contradicts the goal of maximizing profit, even if RSI (50.0) doesn't confirm overbought.
