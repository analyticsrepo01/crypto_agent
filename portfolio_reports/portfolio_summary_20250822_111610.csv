The price ($107700.02) is currently trading below both the SMA 20 ($107770.10) and SMA 50 ($107758.24), indicating a short-term downtrend.

The AI trend analysis also identifies a BEARISH trend with Medium Confidence. However, simultaneously, momentum indicators such as Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are at extreme oversold levels, strongly suggesting a potential for a short-term bounce. Given the aggressive trading mode, a strong SELL signal exists from trend indicators (MACD, SMAs, AI), but the immediate oversold conditions introduce significant risk for new short positions due to potential short-term reversals. Conversely, a BUY entry, while attempting to catch a bounce, would be against the prevailing bearish trend. The absence of 1-hour data further limits long-term trend confirmation.
