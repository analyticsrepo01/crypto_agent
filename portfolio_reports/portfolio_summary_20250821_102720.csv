For potential new trades, the 5-minute technicals present a mixed picture: A bullish MACD crossover (MACD Line > MACD Signal) and positive MACD Histogram indicate short-term upward momentum, aligning with aggressive trading's focus on momentum. However, the price is currently below both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating a short-term bearish price trend. The AI trend analysis is bearish but carries low confidence due to conflicting signals (like the bullish MACD crossover) and invalid data for other indicators.

Without clearer confirmation from a higher timeframe or a stronger confluence of bullish signals (technical score < 4), initiating a new aggressive BUY position is not warranted at this time, nor is there a strong signal for a new SELL.
