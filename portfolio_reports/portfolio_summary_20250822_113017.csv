Extremely high volume, in this context of falling price, suggests confirmation of selling pressure. Furthermore, both Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are in the overbought region, which, as highlighted by the AI trend analysis, suggests a potential short-term pullback within a consolidating market. The AI trend analysis explicitly categorizes the trend as ""BEARISH"" with ""MEDIUM"" confidence. Given no 1-hour data for medium-term trend confirmation and a lack of aligned strong bullish signals (technical score below 4 for a BUY), initiating a new BUY position carries high risk due to the prevailing bearish sentiment from price action, overbought oscillators, and AI analysis.
