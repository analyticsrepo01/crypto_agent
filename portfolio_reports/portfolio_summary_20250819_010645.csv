Critically, there is no 1-hour data available, which prevents confirmation of the medium-term trend. Under the BALANCED TRADING MODE, which prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators across timeframes for high confidence, the absence of 1-hour data and the overbought short-term indicators mean the technical alignment is not strong enough for a BUY.
