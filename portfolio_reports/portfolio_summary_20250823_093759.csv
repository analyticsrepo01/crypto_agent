For potential new aggressive trades, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents crucial medium-term trend confirmation, a key instruction for weighted analysis, significantly lowering the conviction for decisive action. While short-term 5-minute indicators show a bearish lean with price trading below key moving averages (SMA 20 & 50), a negative daily change (-0.10%), and overbought oscillators (Stochastic K at 80.0 and Williams %R at -20.0) suggesting a potential downside correction, the MACD indicators (positive histogram, line above signal) remain bullish. The AI trend analysis indicates a MEDIUM confidence BEARISH trend with HIGH risk. Given these conflicting signals on the short-term and the critical lack of higher-timeframe data, initiating a new high-risk trade is not advisable at this moment, despite the aggressive trading mode.
