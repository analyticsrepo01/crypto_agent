Momentum indicators are signaling overbought conditions, with Stochastic K at 81.8 (well above the crypto-adjusted threshold of 80 for strong overbought) and Williams %R at -18.2 (also in overbought territory), both suggesting an imminent price correction. Furthermore, the MACD has crossed bearishly (MACD Line 1.021 below Signal Line 3.306, with a negative MACD Histogram of -2.285). The AI trend analysis confirms a BEARISH outlook with MEDIUM confidence, attributing it to these overbought momentum indicators and the bearish MACD crossover, despite the current price being marginally above the SMA 20 and SMA 50. Volume is exceptionally high (Volume Ratio: 30638038.88x average), which could amplify any price movement. While the technical signals strongly indicate a SELL for new positions or if the existing position were profitable, the ""CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES"" dictate that a position showing ""❌ UNPROFITABLE to sell"" (Net P&L After Fees: $-0.01) must be held unless it's an emergency stop-loss, which is not the case here.

The current price ($2482.93) is trading above both the SMA 20 ($2481.31) and SMA 50 ($2481.78), indicating a strong short-term uptrend. A bullish MACD crossover is confirmed by the MACD Line (-0.218) being above the Signal Line (-0.315) and a positive MACD Histogram (0.097). Momentum indicators like Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) show strong buying pressure approaching overbought conditions, which in aggressive crypto trading mode can be a strong signal for continuation. Crucially, the current volume (77,602,455) is an astonishing 706816.44x its average, providing exceptional confirmation of the bullish trend and indicating significant market interest. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this with a HIGH confidence BULLISH outlook.
