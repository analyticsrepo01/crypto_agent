While the price is supported above the SMA 20 and SMA 50, the aggressive trading mode prioritizes momentum and volume. The combination of strong bearish momentum indicators and significant selling volume, despite the price being above short-term moving averages, leads to a predominantly bearish outlook for short-term entry.
