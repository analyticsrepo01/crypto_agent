The price is trading consistently below both the SMA 20 ($2481.93) and SMA 50 ($2482.03), with the SMA 20 positioned below the SMA 50, confirming bearish alignment. The MACD shows a bearish crossover (MACD Line -0.004 below Signal 0.010) and a negative histogram (-0.014), reinforcing the downward momentum. The AI trend analysis also confirms a 'BEARISH' trend with 'HIGH' confidence, citing these moving average and MACD alignments, along with high volume on a negative price day indicating significant selling pressure. While the RSI (44.4), Williams %R (-40.1), and Stochastic K (59.9) are in neutral territory, they do not present any bullish divergence or oversold conditions that would warrant a counter-trend BUY. Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of a longer-term trend and forces reliance solely on the short-term 5-minute analysis. Given the current position is 0.0 shares, a SELL action is not possible. Entering a BUY position into a confirmed high-confidence bearish trend is against risk management principles.
