However, the critical constraint is the portfolio's available cash. With $248.90 available and a minimum cash reserve of $90, purchasing 1 share at $231.94 would leave only $16.96 in cash, violating the minimum cash reserve requirement.

While momentum indicators (RSI 20.0, Williams %R -77.7, Stochastic K/D 22.3/22.6) show extreme oversold conditions, suggesting a potential bounce, this does not constitute ""strong technical alignment"" or multiple *confirming* BUY indicators as required. Our strategy demands a technical score of 6+ for a high-priority BUY, and the current strong bearish trend gives a low score. Moreover, our available cash ($248.90) is insufficient to purchase even one share of META ($763.81). Conversely, despite the strongly positive news sentiment (+0.60) regarding AI-driven ad growth and earnings, a SELL action is explicitly avoided according to our rules (""Avoid SELL on strongly positive news (sentiment > +0.5)""). Since we hold 0 shares, a SELL is not an option anyway.
