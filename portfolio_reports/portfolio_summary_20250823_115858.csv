For new trades, the technical analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with medium confidence, as confirmed by the AI, with price trading below both the SMA 20 and SMA 50. While the MACD has registered a recent bullish crossover and its histogram is slightly positive, suggesting some short-term momentum, other key momentum indicators like Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are nearing overbought conditions. This indicates that any current buying pressure may be exhausting or a reversal could be imminent. Furthermore, the extremely high volume (716537.16x average) on a day with a negative price change, alongside the AI's mention of negative OBV, suggests strong selling pressure is active.
