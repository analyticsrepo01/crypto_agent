While the price is above the SMA 20 and SMA 50 (short-term bullish alignment), the momentum and oscillator indicators show strong bearish signals. Williams %R (-18.2) and Stochastic K (81.8) both indicate overbought conditions, which are considered stronger sell signals in crypto when crossing extreme thresholds. Furthermore, the MACD has a bearish crossover (MACD Line below Signal), suggesting a shift to downward momentum. The 0.00% daily change indicates stagnation, and with conflicting and increasingly bearish momentum signals coupled with high volume, it's prudent to lock in profits before a potential reversal. In aggressive trading mode, maximizing profit through decisive action and quick exits on weakening signals is prioritized.",N/A,107807.83,50.0001934757,sim_1755703410,Submitted,0.00046379,0,0,0.000102,2025-08-20,0.0,1050.0001934757,15
