This bearish movement is confirmed by extremely high volume. However, a critical constraint prevents a SELL action: the current position is ""❌ UNPROFITABLE to sell"" (Net P&L After Fees: $-0.01) and has not triggered a 2%+ stop-loss.

The AI Trend Analysis explicitly flags the trend as NEUTRAL with LOW Confidence and notes ""significant indecision."" Furthermore, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a higher confidence assessment of the medium-term trend.
