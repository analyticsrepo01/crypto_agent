The RSI (76.3), Stochastic K (89.4), and Williams %R (-10.6) are all significantly above typical overbought thresholds, indicating a high probability of an imminent price correction or pullback. Furthermore, the price is currently trading above the Upper Bollinger Band, reinforcing the unsustainable extended nature of the current price action. The AI Trend Analysis explicitly flags a ""High Risk"" level due to these overbought conditions, despite a ""BULLISH"" trend. This confluence of strong overbought signals satisfies the criteria for a high-priority SELL, aligning with the ""Balanced Trading Mode"" which prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators for trades. Although there is no news sentiment available, the clear technical warning signs are sufficient for this decision.
