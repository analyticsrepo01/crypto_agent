The AI Trend Analysis also highlights these overbought conditions, suggesting a potential short-term pullback or consolidation. Crucially, the 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, preventing a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and alignment. As per the ""BALANCED TRADING MODE,"" high confidence trades require strong technical alignment across multiple timeframes, with 1-hour trends weighted more heavily. Without this medium-term confirmation, and with short-term indicators showing overbought conditions, initiating a new BUY position would contradict the strategy's emphasis on capital preservation and avoiding trades during periods of potential high volatility or unclear direction.

Although the stock's current price is below the 5-minute SMAs and MACD remains bearish, the extreme oversold condition combined with high volume (1909589.00x average) suggests a compelling opportunity for a short-term rebound.
