The price is also slightly below SMA 20. These strong bearish indicators contribute to a low technical score (estimated at 3). While the technicals meet the criteria for a high-priority SELL (score 4-), the current portfolio holds 0 shares of NFLX, making a SELL order (to close a position) impossible.
