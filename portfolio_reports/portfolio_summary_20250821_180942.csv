The current price ($107700.02) is below both the 20-period ($107780.88) and 50-period ($107762.55) Simple Moving Averages, confirming bearish price action. Both Stochastic K (90.5) and Williams %R (-9.5) are in overbought territory; in a confirmed bearish trend, this suggests a peak in recent upward movement or exhaustion, positioning for further decline, as confirmed by the AI analysis. The AI trend analysis explicitly states a ""BEARISH"" trend with ""HIGH"" confidence and ""HIGH"" risk. This bearish sentiment is reinforced by extremely high current volume (78,827,812, with a Volume Ratio of 31 million times average), which validates the strength of the current price movement.

Oscillators like Williams %R (-20.1) and Stochastic K (79.9) are in or near overbought territory, suggesting potential downside reversal.
