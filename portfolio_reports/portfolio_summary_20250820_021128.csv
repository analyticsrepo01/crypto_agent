The AI trend analysis explicitly confirms this overbought state and warns of a ""HIGH"" risk level, suggesting a ""high probability of a short-term pullback or correction.""

Additionally, Stochastic K (79.9) is in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term pullback. The AI's overall trend analysis is 'BEARISH' with 'MEDIUM' confidence, yet acknowledges a 'bullish MACD cross'. Crucially, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis, making it impossible to confirm a medium-term trend.
