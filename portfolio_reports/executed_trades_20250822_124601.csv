Despite a slight daily price dip (-0.10%), the 5-minute timeframe shows compelling bullish signals for a rebound. Both Williams %R (-95.0) and Stochastic K (5.0) are deeply oversold, which are strong crypto-adjusted BUY signals indicating a high probability of an upward reversal. The MACD also exhibits a bullish crossover (MACD Line 0.013 > Signal Line 0.004) from a consolidated state, confirming increasing upward momentum. While current volume is extremely high and the AI notes it on a ""negative movement,"" the overall technical picture, especially the oversold momentum, strongly suggests this could be a capitulation or shake-out phase before a bounce. The AI Trend Analysis explicitly confirms a BULLISH trend with MEDIUM confidence, aligning with this interpretation. Given the current position is at cost ($120.30) and ""UNPROFITABLE to sell"" as per fee-aware rules, and the strong buy signals, accumulating more shares to capitalize on the anticipated rebound is the optimal aggressive strategy to maximize profit.",N/A,120.3,50.0,sim_1755881142,Submitted,0.415628,0,0,0.000124,2025-08-22,0.0,950.0,11
