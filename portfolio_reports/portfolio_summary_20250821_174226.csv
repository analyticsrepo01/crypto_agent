Momentum indicators corroborate this bearish bias: MACD Histogram (-3.519) is negative, and the MACD Line (-2.175) is below its Signal Line (1.344), confirming strong negative momentum.

Furthermore, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a stronger medium-term trend confirmation, which is crucial for aggressive trading.
