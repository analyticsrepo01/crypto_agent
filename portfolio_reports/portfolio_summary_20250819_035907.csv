However, multiple short-term momentum indicators including RSI (67.2), Williams %R (-16.0), and Stochastic K (84.0) are signaling that the stock is currently in overbought territory. This increases the risk of an immediate pullback or consolidation, which contradicts the ""Balanced Trading Mode"" preference for capital preservation and avoiding trades during potentially high volatility periods or risky entry points. Furthermore, the critical absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis. According to the strategy, high confidence and high-priority trades require alignment across both timeframes, and 1-hour trends are weighted more heavily. Without this crucial medium-term confirmation, a high-priority BUY is not feasible.
