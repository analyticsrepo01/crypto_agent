Furthermore, conflicting technical signals prevent an actionable new trade in aggressive mode. While the price shows a significant +4.84% daily increase on exceptionally high volume (20078841.30x average) and is trading above its 5-minute SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating short-term bullish momentum, this is contradicted by bearish momentum from the MACD (negative histogram and MACD line below signal) and a low RSI of 37.3. The absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a more robust trend confirmation. The overall technical score of 2.5 does not meet the ""4+"" threshold for an aggressive BUY or the ""6-"" threshold for an aggressive SELL. The AI Trend also indicates NEUTRAL with MEDIUM confidence.

The 5-minute timeframe shows robust bullish momentum: Price ($2482.92) is strongly positioned above both SMA 20 ($2482.30) and SMA 50 ($2481.88), with SMAs in a bullish alignment. MACD exhibits a clear bullish crossover (MACD Line 0.307 > MACD Signal 0.201) with a positive and increasing histogram (0.105), indicating strong upward momentum. Momentum indicators like Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are in the upper range, confirming significant buying pressure. Crucially, current volume (77,826,322) is an astounding 713566.59x the average, providing strong confirmation for the bullish trend. The AI Trend Analysis also confirms a ""BULLISH"" trend with ""HIGH"" confidence.

The AI trend analysis, despite its low confidence and high-risk assessment, points to a BULLISH trend. Price is consolidating slightly above key moving averages (SMA 20 and SMA 50), providing a support base. Furthermore, the anomalous high volume (34146.20x average) coinciding with a 0.00% daily price change suggests significant market activity that could precede a strong directional move, likely upwards given the oversold state. While the MACD shows a bearish crossover, in an AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, the strong oversold oscillators are prioritized for a high-risk, high-reward entry, anticipating a swift bounce to maximize profit.
