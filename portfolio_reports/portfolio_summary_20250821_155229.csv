While the price is holding above both the 20-period and 50-period Simple Moving Averages, indicating short-term support, momentum indicators such as MACD (negative histogram and line below signal) show bearish weakness. Crucially, the Volume Ratio is extremely high (31M times average), signaling significant market activity and potential for a large move, which an aggressive trader would typically prioritize. However, this high volume is not clearly aligned with a strong directional momentum from other indicators, as the MACD is bearish. The absence of 1-hour timeframe data significantly hinders the ability to confirm a medium-term trend, which is critical for directional conviction. The AI trend analysis labels the current situation as ""NEUTRAL"" with ""LOW"" confidence due to these conflicting signals. Given these mixed indicators, particularly the bearish MACD counteracting the high volume and SMA support, the overall technical score for a BUY does not meet the aggressive mode's threshold of 4+. Engaging in a trade with such ambiguity, even in aggressive mode, represents unquantifiable risk rather than a high-potential opportunity.

Price is firmly above both the SMA 20 ($2482.18) and SMA 50 ($2482.08), with a clear bullish crossover (SMA 20 > 50). The MACD line is positive and firmly above its signal line with a positive histogram (0.110), indicating sustained upward momentum.
