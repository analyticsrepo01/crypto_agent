Both the Williams %R (-15.4) and Stochastic K (84.6) are in extreme overbought territory, signaling an imminent price reversal or correction, which aligns with crypto-adjusted thresholds where such extreme readings are considered strong signals. Furthermore, a clear bearish MACD crossover (MACD Line at 6.974 below Signal Line at 7.953) confirms a downward shift in momentum. The AI trend analysis corroborates these findings, identifying a BEARISH trend with HIGH confidence and HIGH risk, specifically noting the overbought conditions and MACD crossover as key drivers.
