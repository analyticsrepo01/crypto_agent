The current price ($107700.02) is below both the 20-day ($107764.71) and 50-day ($107762.55) Simple Moving Averages, indicating downward momentum. The MACD histogram is negative (-2.477), and the MACD line (4.897) is below the MACD Signal (7.374), confirming a bearish crossover. Furthermore, there is extremely high volume (Volume Ratio: 30750628.70x average) during this negative price movement, which strongly reinforces the downward pressure. The AI Trend Analysis also confirms a HIGH confidence BEARISH trend. This aggressive mode technical score would typically trigger a SELL action (score 10). However, the current position analysis indicates a Net P&L of $-0.01, rendering it UNPROFITABLE to sell after accounting for fees. According to CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULE #4, an unprofitable position cannot be sold unless a stop-loss is triggered (2%+ loss), which is not currently met. Therefore, despite the overwhelming bearish technical signals, the mandatory fee-aware sell rules dictate a HOLD recommendation for the existing position to avoid crystallizing a loss.",10.0,HIGH,BEARISH,HIGH,HIGH,42.85733214962425,107764.7065,107762.55040000001,-2.476826897440813,-0.10000201284080912,30750628.702154256,AGGRESSIVE
