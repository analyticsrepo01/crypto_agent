Price is also below SMA 20 and SMA 50, and MACD histogram is negative, leaning bearish. Despite the extraordinarily high Volume Ratio (36369.91x average), the complete lack of price movement means there's no actionable momentum confirmation. The AI trend analysis indicates a BEARISH trend but with LOW confidence, further emphasizing the market's stagnant nature. Without 1-hour data, a robust medium-term trend confirmation is absent.
