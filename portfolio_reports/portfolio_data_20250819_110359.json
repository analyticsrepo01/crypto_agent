The AI Trend Analysis reinforces this with a \"BEARISH\" trend, \"HIGH\" confidence, and \"HIGH\" risk level. While oscillators like RSI (32.1), Williams %R (-88.3), and Stochastic K (11.7) show oversold conditions, these are considered potential reversal signals within the established strong bearish sentiment, not an indication of a bullish trend reversal. No 1-hour data is available, preventing dual-timeframe alignment, which is crucial for high confidence trades in Balanced Trading Mode. My current technical score for a potential BUY is very low (2), far below the required 6+ for a high-priority BUY. Given the strong bearish technicals, high risk, and lack of dual-timeframe confirmation, initiating a BUY position is not aligned with the capital preservation and strong technical alignment principles of the Balanced Trading Mode. As there is no current position in AAPL, a SELL action is not applicable.

While short-term momentum indicators like RSI (31.3), Williams %R (-95.4), and Stochastic K (4.6) show oversold conditions, the AI reasoning explicitly highlights these as \"short-term signals against the dominant bearish trend,\" which aligns with the balanced trading mode's focus on trend alignment over counter-trend scalps. Furthermore, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a crucial dual-timeframe confirmation, which is a key requirement for high-confidence trades under this strategy. The \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\" prioritizes capital preservation and demands strong technical alignment, avoiding trades during high volatility and high risk.

My current technical score for a potential BUY is very low (2), far below the required 6+ for a high-priority BUY.

This creates conflicting signals for an immediate trade entry. Furthermore, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data and valid volume data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and assessment of conviction, leading to incomplete information. The AI explicitly notes a \"HIGH Risk Level\" for this situation. In 'BALANCED TRADING MODE', the strategy prioritizes capital preservation, demands multiple confirming indicators, and requires strong technical alignment, while avoiding trades during high volatility. The current conflicting indicators, missing data, and high-risk assessment mean there is no strong technical alignment for either a BUY or a SELL, despite the underlying bearish trend.

While this technical setup meets the criteria for a high-priority SELL (technical score 4-), we hold no current position in AMZN, thus a SELL action is not possible.

While short-term momentum indicators (RSI, Williams %R, Stochastic K) are oversold, in a high-risk, strong bearish trend, these do not typically signal an immediate reversal but rather indicate continued downside pressure.

Crucially, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual timeframe analysis, which is explicitly required for high-confidence trades and weighting direction more heavily. The AI Trend Analysis also identifies the trend as NEUTRAL with LOW Confidence and MEDIUM Risk. In a \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\" that prioritizes capital preservation, demands multiple confirming indicators, and focuses on strong technical alignment, these mixed signals and the lack of complete data warrant a cautious approach.

While oscillators like RSI (33.7), Williams %R (-76.6), and Stochastic K (23.4) indicate oversold conditions that *could* precede a bounce, these are counter-trend signals heavily outweighed by the strong bearish momentum and high volatility. Crucially, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and makes it impossible to achieve the required timeframe alignment and confidence for a high-priority trade. The \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\" prioritizes capital preservation, avoids trades during high volatility periods (AI highlights \"HIGH\" risk and volatility), and demands multiple confirming indicators across timeframes. With no higher timeframe confirmation and a clear bearish trend combined with high volatility, initiating a BUY trade would be against the strategy's risk management principles. Since there is no current position, a SELL action is not applicable.

The AI trend analysis confirms a \"BEARISH\" trend with \"HIGH\" confidence for the available data, citing price below key moving averages and a bearish MACD crossover. However, the critical lack of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis. According to the strategy's \"CRITICAL DUAL TIMEFRAME INSTRUCTION,\" 1-hour trends should be weighted more heavily, and high confidence is only achieved when both timeframes agree. Without 1-hour data, timeframe alignment cannot be assessed, leading to a significant reduction in overall trade confidence. The \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\" prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators, including across timeframes. Given the missing critical data, proceeding with a SELL, despite the short-term bearish indicators, would violate the principle of strong technical alignment across timeframes and increase risk.

RSI (42.7), Williams %R (-65.8), and Stochastic K (34.2) are all in bearish/neutral territory. While MACD shows a recent bullish crossover (MACD Line -10.571 > Signal -10.615), the AI reasoning correctly identifies this as a potential counter-trend movement within a dominant bearish structure, as both MACD lines remain deeply negative. Critically, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a dual-timeframe analysis and the confirmation of the medium-term trend, which is essential for high-confidence trades in 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' and for meeting the 'Timeframe Alignment' requirement. Given the strong bearish technical signals, the high-risk assessment, and the lack of medium-term confirmation, a BUY action would contradict the strategy's emphasis on capital preservation, requiring a technical score of 6+ for high-priority buys, which is clearly not met here.

As there is no current position to sell and the bearish short-term outlook combined with the absence of medium-term confirmation and high risk makes a BUY unacceptable, the most prudent action, prioritizing capital preservation as per the active trading mode, is to HOLD and wait for clearer, multi-timeframe confirmed signals or a reduction in risk.",

The AI Trend Analysis reinforces this with a \"BEARISH\" trend, \"HIGH\" confidence, and \"HIGH\" risk level. While oscillators like RSI (32.1), Williams %R (-88.3), and Stochastic K (11.7) show oversold conditions, these are considered potential reversal signals within the established strong bearish sentiment, not an indication of a bullish trend reversal. No 1-hour data is available, preventing dual-timeframe alignment, which is crucial for high confidence trades in Balanced Trading Mode. My current technical score for a potential BUY is very low (2), far below the required 6+ for a high-priority BUY. Given the strong bearish technicals, high risk, and lack of dual-timeframe confirmation, initiating a BUY position is not aligned with the capital preservation and strong technical alignment principles of the Balanced Trading Mode. As there is no current position in AAPL, a SELL action is not applicable. Therefore, the prudent recommendation is to HOLD and wait for clearer bullish technical alignment or a confirmed trend reversal.",
