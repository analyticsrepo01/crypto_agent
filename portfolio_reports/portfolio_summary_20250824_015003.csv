While the price ($2482.93) is slightly above the flat SMA 20 ($2481.93) and SMA 50 ($2482.08), the MACD histogram (-0.068) and MACD Line (-0.110) being below the Signal (-0.042) indicate bearish momentum. The AI Trend Analysis confirms a NEUTRAL trend with HIGH confidence, despite extremely high current volume (77,666,039) compared to its MA (109). This suggests consolidation without a clear directional breakout. No 1-hour data is available for medium-term trend confirmation.
