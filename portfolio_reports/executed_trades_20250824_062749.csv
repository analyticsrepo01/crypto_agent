Price ($577.66) is above both 5-minute SMA 20 and SMA 50 ($575.53), and the AI confirms bullish MACD signals, supporting short-term strength. While the AI notes an overbought condition, the aggressive trading mode prioritizes strong momentum and volume for profit maximization. No 1-hour data is available, so the decision relies on robust 5-minute technicals and the AI's bullish trend confirmation. There is no news to impact the decision. The existing BCHUSD position is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L $-0.01) and therefore must be HELD as per the critical fee-aware sell rules, awaiting price recovery. This BUY recommendation is for adding new shares to capitalize on the confirmed bullish momentum, aligning with the aggressive trading strategy to maximize profit.",N/A,577.66,50.0,sim_1756031257,Submitted,0.086556,0,0,0.000116,2025-08-24,0.0,950.0,64
