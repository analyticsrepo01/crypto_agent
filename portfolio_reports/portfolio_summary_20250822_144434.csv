As per critical fee-aware sell rules, a HOLD action is absolutely mandatory in such a scenario, unless a 2%+ stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here as the gross P&L is positive. While 5-minute technical indicators show mixed signals, there is a clear bearish momentum indicated by the MACD histogram (-7.577) and MACD line (-13.640), aligning with the AI's BEARISH trend analysis. The AI also suggests the price is ""significantly overbought"", although the RSI (33.3) does not confirm an overbought condition. Price is currently above the 20 and 50 SMAs which provides a minor bullish signal.
