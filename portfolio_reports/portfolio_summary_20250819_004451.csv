The AI Trend Analysis corroborates these overbought conditions. Critically, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of the medium-term trend and thus prohibits a high-confidence trade as per the balanced strategy's requirement for dual timeframe alignment. Furthermore, the extremely high Volume Ratio (1928880.00x average) indicates a period of high volatility, which the BALANCED TRADING MODE explicitly avoids for new trades to prioritize capital preservation.
