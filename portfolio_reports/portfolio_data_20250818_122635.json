      "reasoning": "Technical analysis indicates a weak bearish bias for AAPL. The current price is consistently below key moving averages (SMA 20, 50, EMA 12, 26) and the Bollinger Band middle line, signaling a downward short-term trend. The Stochastic K is also below D, confirming bearish momentum. While the MACD histogram is slightly positive and some momentum indicators (RSI, Williams %R) are neutral, the AI trend analysis identifies a BEARISH trend, albeit with low confidence, suggesting a weak or sideways downward movement. Given the balanced trading mode's emphasis on capital preservation and the slightly negative P&L on the current position, selling is recommended to mitigate further potential losses, especially since there is no news sentiment to counteract the bearish technical lean. The lack of strong bullish conviction prevents a HOLD recommendation, and the \"low confidence\" in the bearish trend prevents a HIGH priority SELL.",

Even if cash were available, the technical picture for META is mixed and does not meet the \"strong technical alignment\" required for a high-priority BUY in Balanced Trading Mode. While there are some short-term bullish signals, such as a positive MACD histogram and MACD line crossover above its signal line, and the price is slightly above its SMA 20 and EMA 12, longer-term moving averages (SMA 50, EMA 26) remain above the current price, indicating an underlying bearish trend. The AI trend analysis confirms a \"NEUTRAL\" trend with a \"MEDIUM\" risk level, highlighting an underlying downtrend despite short-term momentum. RSI and Williams %R are neutral. Volume data is unavailable. With no news sentiment to provide additional conviction, and multiple confirming indicators not strongly aligning for either a BUY or SELL, the trade does not meet the criteria for a high-priority action.",

      "reasoning": "A BUY order for AMZN is not feasible at this time due to insufficient available cash ($239.56) to maintain the minimum $100 cash reserve after purchasing one share ($230.42). Beyond the cash constraint, the technical indicators present a mixed and largely neutral picture. While the price is marginally above key short-term moving averages (SMA 20, SMA 50, EMA 12, EMA 26) and the Bollinger Band middle line, the MACD shows a bearish crossover (MACD Line 0.061 below Signal 0.070, Histogram -0.009), suggesting bearish momentum. RSI and momentum indicators (Williams %R, Stochastic) are all in neutral territory, indicating a lack of strong buying or selling pressure. Crucially, the volume data is missing, preventing any confirmation of price movements. The AI trend analysis, despite labeling the trend \"BULLISH\" with \"LOW\" confidence, acknowledges a \"bearish MACD crossover\" and a \"lack of strong direction.\" Adhering to the Balanced Trading Mode, which requires strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators for high-priority trades and prioritizes capital preservation, this current technical setup does not meet the criteria for a high-priority BUY (score 6+) nor SELL (score 4-). The lack of a clear, confirmed technical signal combined with the portfolio's cash constraint makes a HOLD decision prudent.",

      "reasoning": "Current cash ($239.56) is insufficient to purchase 1 share of NFLX ($1244.43), making a BUY action impossible given the trade size constraint of 1 share. Furthermore, even if affordable, the technical indicators present conflicting signals. While price is above key moving averages (SMA 20, SMA 50, EMA 12 > EMA 26) and within the upper half of Bollinger Bands, indicating a weak bullish bias, the MACD histogram is negative, and the MACD line is below its signal line, signaling bearish momentum. The AI Trend analysis confirms a \"WEAK_BULLISH\" trend but notes that MACD is signaling bearish. Crucially, volume data is missing/invalid, which significantly compromises the reliability of any trend confirmation and adds considerable risk. In BALANCED TRADING MODE, strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators are required for a BUY, and this situation exhibits conflicting signals and a critical data gap.

The AI Trend Analysis explicitly flags a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence and HIGH risk, citing these overbought indicators and an underlying downtrend. The conflicting signals do not provide the strong technical alignment required for a high-priority trade in a Balanced Trading Mode, which prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators. Furthermore, with zero current shares, a SELL action is not possible. A BUY action is not advisable given the highly overbought momentum and the AI's bearish outlook, and additionally, available cash ($239.56) is insufficient to purchase one share ($517.28). Therefore, the most prudent action is to HOLD and monitor, awaiting clearer technical alignment or a pullback to more favorable entry levels.",

This is a critical portfolio constraint violation. Furthermore, despite an underlying bullish trend indicated by the price being above key moving averages, short-term momentum indicators (RSI, Williams %R, Stochastic) are in overbought territory, and the price is at the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting potential for a near-term consolidation or pullback. The invalid volume data prevents confirmation of trend strength, and the balanced trading mode prioritizes capital preservation by avoiding trades during high volatility or with conflicting indicators. The technical picture does not meet the \"technical scores 6+\" or \"multiple confirming indicators\" requirement for a high-priority BUY.",

This is further confirmed by extremely high readings on the Stochastic Oscillator (K: 91.8, D: 92.3) and Williams %R (-8.2), both indicating the stock is in overbought territory. The RSI (66.6) is also nearing the overbought threshold. While the underlying AI Trend analysis confirms a \"BULLISH\" trend supported by positive moving average crossovers and MACD, it also explicitly flags a \"HIGH\" risk level due to these overbought conditions, advising of an increased likelihood of a near-term pullback. In a balanced trading mode, capital preservation is paramount, and selling an overbought asset aligns with this strategy to mitigate the risk of a price correction and potentially lock in profits.

RSI (74.8), Williams %R (-5.8), and Stochastic (K: 94.2, D: 86.1) are all deep in overbought territory. The price has also breached the Upper Bollinger Band ($357.00 > $356.71), signaling a potential imminent pullback or consolidation. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, classifying the trend as \"BEARISH\" with \"HIGH\" risk, explicitly reasoning that the stock is critically overbought. These multiple confirming indicators strongly suggest avoiding a long position to preserve capital, aligning with the Balanced Trading Mode's focus on capital preservation and avoiding trades during high volatility from extreme conditions.

RSI and momentum indicators (Williams %R, Stochastic) are all in neutral territory, indicating a lack of strong buying or selling pressure. Crucially, the volume data is missing, preventing any confirmation of price movements. The AI trend analysis, despite labeling the trend \"BULLISH\" with \"LOW\" confidence, acknowledges a \"bearish MACD crossover\" and a \"lack of strong direction.\" Adhering to the Balanced Trading Mode, which requires strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators for high-priority trades and prioritizes capital preservation, this current technical setup does not meet the criteria for a high-priority BUY (score 6+) nor SELL (score 4-).

The AI Trend Analysis explicitly flags a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence and HIGH risk, citing these overbought indicators and an underlying downtrend. The conflicting signals do not provide the strong technical alignment required for a high-priority trade in a Balanced Trading Mode, which prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators. Furthermore, with zero current shares, a SELL action is not possible. A BUY action is not advisable given the highly overbought momentum and the AI's bearish outlook, and additionally, available cash ($239.56) is insufficient to purchase one share ($517.28).

The MACD Histogram is slightly positive, On-Balance Volume (OBV) is positive, and the AI trend analysis notes a \"weak bullish bias.\" Crucially, the AI's confidence is LOW, and it identifies \"conflicting directional momentum\" within a \"weak, likely sideways trend.\" The technical score of 4 is borderline for a SELL signal but does not reflect the \"strong technical alignment\" demanded by the balanced trading mode. Given the mixed signals, lack of clear confirming indicators across the board, and the AI's assessment of conflicting momentum and low confidence, initiating a trade would go against the \"capital preservation\" and \"avoid trades during high volatility periods\" (interpreted here as periods of high uncertainty/conflicting signals) principles.

However, there are conflicting short-term bullish signals, including a recent bullish MACD crossover and momentum indicators (RSI 34.2, Williams %R -70.5, Stochastic K 29.5) nearing oversold conditions, suggesting a potential bounce within the downtrend.

The calculated technical score is 3, which is below the threshold for a high-priority BUY (6+). Furthermore, the available cash ($239.54) is insufficient to execute a 1-share BUY order ($230.32) while maintaining the mandatory minimum cash reserve of $100 ($239.54 - $230.32 = $9.22, which is less than $100).

This is a direct violation of portfolio constraints. Secondly, while price action shows bullish signs (above SMA/EMA and Bollinger Middle Band), momentum indicators are conflicting: MACD shows a bearish crossover and a negative histogram, and both Stochastic (%K: 75.4, %D: 69.6) and Williams %R (-24.6) indicate overbought conditions, suggesting a potential reversal or loss of upward momentum.

In \"BALANCED TRADING MODE,\" capital preservation is prioritized, demanding multiple confirming indicators and advising against trades during high volatility or when technical alignment is not strong. The conflicting signals between the strong underlying trend and the immediate overbought conditions mean there isn't strong alignment for a new BUY, nor is there sufficient reason to SELL a strongly trending asset. Holding the current position is the most prudent action to avoid buying at a potential short-term peak while maintaining exposure to the bullish trend.",

Even if cash were available, the technical picture for ADBE is mixed and does not meet the \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\" requirements for a high-priority BUY. While MACD, RSI, and Stochastic indicators show some bullish momentum, the price is consolidating around key moving averages (below SMA 50 and EMA 26), suggesting resistance. The AI trend analysis is NEUTRAL with LOW confidence and MEDIUM risk, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. Crucially, the volume data is invalid/missing (-1), which prevents confirmation of any technical signals and significantly increases uncertainty. The technical score of 4.0 is below the 6+ required for a high-priority BUY, and the lack of strong, confirming technical alignment, particularly due to the missing volume data, makes any trade undesirable. As we currently hold 0 shares, a SELL action is not possible.",
