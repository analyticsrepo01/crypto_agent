Furthermore, the SMA 20 has crossed below the SMA 50, which is a bearish crossover. The AI trend analysis indicates a ""NEUTRAL"" trend with ""LOW"" confidence and ""HIGH"" risk, citing ""underlying weakness."" Crucially, 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, preventing a higher-weighted medium-term trend confirmation as per instructions. Despite extremely high current volume, the daily price change is minimal (+0.10%), suggesting indecision or potential distribution rather than a strong directional move. Given the aggressive trading mode, which prioritizes momentum, the bearish MACD and SMA crossover signals, combined with the AI's high-risk assessment, do not provide the strong technical confirmation (technical score 4+) required for a decisive BUY action.
