Its RSI (14) is at 27.6, Williams %R is at -89.4, and both Stochastic K (10.6) and D (19.2) are well below the 20-level, all signaling a strong oversold state. Furthermore, the price is trading below its lower Bollinger Band, a classic setup for an imminent upward correction or bounce. While lagging indicators like MACD and moving averages reflect the recent bearish price action, the confluence of these leading oversold indicators, confirmed by the AI's ""BULLISH"" trend analysis (due to oversold conditions), strongly suggests a high probability of a short-term relief rally. This aligns with the balanced trading mode's focus on strong technical alignment for counter-trend reversals. There is no news sentiment available to introduce additional risk.",N/A,229.83,229.83,84,Filled,1.0,0.0,229.9991,1.012549,963.6,377.15999999999997,2

The current price ($356.61) is firmly above all key moving averages (SMA 20, SMA 50, EMA 12, EMA 26), signaling robust upward momentum. MACD shows a clear bullish crossover with a positive histogram, reinforcing the buy signal. RSI (60.3) is in bullish territory but not overbought, allowing for further upside. Momentum indicators like Stochastic K (71.4) and D (75.1) confirm strong upward price action. The AI trend analysis rates the trend as BULLISH with HIGH confidence, citing overwhelming positive technical posture and zero bearish signals. Although current volume data is unavailable, the confluence of strong confirming indicators outweighs this absence for a high-priority buy in the balanced trading mode. The trade aligns with portfolio constraints and cash reserves.",N/A,356.61,356.61,86,Filled,1.0,0.0,356.61,1.014658,963.6,377.15999999999997,2
