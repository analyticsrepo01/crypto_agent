The current price ($107700.02) is trading below both the 20-period ($107764.71) and 50-period ($107766.86) Simple Moving Averages, with a bearish SMA alignment (SMA20 < SMA50). Both Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are in the overbought territory, signaling a high probability of a downward price reversal, which are particularly strong signals in crypto markets. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence, specifically noting the price below key moving averages, negative daily change (-0.10%), and inferred high selling volume. While the MACD shows a bullish crossover (Line > Signal) and positive histogram, this is strongly counteracted by the overwhelming bearish signals from price action, momentum oscillators, and the overall AI trend. The extremely high current volume (31,359,568.49x average) suggests conviction behind the current price movement, likely fueling selling pressure as indicated by the AI. Given the aggressive mode's emphasis on momentum and quick action, we prioritize the strong bearish confluence despite the conflicting MACD.

This bullish price action is powerfully supported by an exceptionally high volume ratio (708077.03x average), indicating significant market interest and confirmation of the upward trend. While the absence of 1-hour data limits comprehensive dual timeframe analysis, leading to a medium confidence level, and the AI notes ""HIGH"" risk with caveats regarding ""negative OBV"" and ""anomalous zero values,"" the immediate short-term momentum and volume are compelling. Under AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, which prioritizes momentum and volume indicators for decisive action and accepts higher risk, a BUY signal is actionable. The existing position is currently unprofitable (Net P&L: $-0.06) and falls under the mandatory 'UNPROFITABLE to sell' rule, thus requiring a HOLD for those shares.
