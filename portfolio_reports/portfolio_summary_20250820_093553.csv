Price is trading above both the 20 and 50-period Simple Moving Averages, confirming an uptrend. While MACD shows short-term bearishness, key momentum oscillators (RSI at 30.1, Williams %R at -82.6, and Stochastic K at 17.4) are all deep in oversold territory. In crypto, these extreme oversold conditions often precede a strong rebound or continuation of an existing upward trend after a minor pullback.
