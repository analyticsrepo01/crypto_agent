For potential new trades, the 5-minute timeframe presents mixed technical signals: MACD histogram shows bullish momentum (3.652), but the price ($107700.02) is below both the SMA 20 ($107770.10) and SMA 50 ($107762.55), indicating a short-term bearish bias. Furthermore, both Stochastic K (80.0) and Williams %R (-20.0) are in overbought territory, suggesting a potential for a near-term pullback or reversal. RSI at 50.0 is neutral. The AI Trend Analysis explicitly identifies the trend as NEUTRAL with LOW Confidence and MEDIUM Risk, highlighting ""mixed signals"" and ""consolidation without a clear directional bias."" The absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual timeframe analysis and confirmation of any medium-term trend. Under aggressive trading mode, with BUY signals requiring a technical score of 4+ and the current indicators being contradictory (bullish MACD vs. bearish price action and overbought oscillators), initiating a new position is not justified.

As per mandatory trading rules, a position cannot be sold at a loss unless it triggers a stop-loss (2%+ loss), which is not the case here. Technically, the 5-minute data presents a mixed but overall bearish outlook. The MACD histogram (-0.032) and MACD line (-0.109) are bearish, with the MACD line below its signal. Momentum oscillators Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are in overbought territory, strongly suggesting a potential downward reversal. Although the price ($2482.92) is slightly above the SMA 20 ($2482.18) and SMA 50 ($2482.23), this provides only weak bullish support. The AI Trend is ""BEARISH"" with ""LOW"" confidence, and the absence of 1-hour data prevents comprehensive dual-timeframe alignment. Extremely high volume (700583.32x average) indicates significant activity but lacks a clear directional signal given the mixed price action.

However, the AI trend analysis, while bullish, has LOW confidence due to conflicting signals (potential overbought by Bollinger Bands, neutral RSI, and absence of a clear underlying trend).
