According to aggressive trading rules, we must HOLD an unprofitable position unless a 2%+ stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here. Technical indicators show mixed signals on the 5-minute timeframe: MACD displays bearish momentum with its line below the signal and a negative histogram, and the AI trend analysis indicates weak bearish strength. However, the price is currently holding above the 20 and 50-period Simple Moving Averages, and the AI confidence is low. High volume suggests active trading, but the direction remains ambiguous without 1-hour confirmation.

While there are minor bullish signals from the MACD (line above signal, slightly positive histogram) and price position relative to SMAs (above SMA20 and SMA50), key momentum indicators like RSI, Stochastic K, and Williams %R are all neutral (~50). The extremely high current volume relative to its moving average, without any price movement, suggests a lack of clear directional conviction or strong momentum, which is critical for aggressive trading. Under AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, the absence of strong, discernible momentum negates immediate high-profit entry opportunities. Furthermore, the current position is ‚ùå UNPROFITABLE to sell, with a net P&L of $-0.26, which is well below the 2% stop-loss threshold.

Technical analysis for a new trade shows a conflicted market: short-term trend indicators (MACD, price below SMAs) are bearish, but momentum oscillators (Williams %R, Stochastic K) are deeply oversold, suggesting a potential bounce. The AI trend analysis is bearish with low confidence, indicating high uncertainty. Extremely high volume with flat price adds to the ambiguity.
