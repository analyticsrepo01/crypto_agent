For new potential trades, the technical signals are conflicting. Price is currently trading above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating weak short-term bullishness, and this is supported by extremely high volume, which signifies strong market activity. However, the MACD shows a clear bearish crossover, a reliable and strong bearish signal for crypto markets. Other momentum indicators like RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic are perfectly neutral. The AI trend analysis confirms this mixed picture, identifying a \"BULLISH\" trend but with \"LOW confidence\" and \"HIGH risk\" due to \"significant conflicting signals, warranting caution.\" While the aggressive trading mode encourages decisive action, the lack of clear directional conviction, coupled with strong conflicting momentum indicators and the AI's cautionary stance, dictates a HOLD.

Despite the aggressive trading mode, realizing a loss without a specific stop-loss condition is explicitly prohibited. Technical analysis shows mixed signals on the 5-minute timeframe: price is below bearishly aligned SMA 20 and SMA 50, and the AI trend analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with medium confidence, supported by high volume interpreted as selling pressure. However, momentum indicators like MACD Histogram (positive) and Stochastic K (79.9, near overbought) show some short-term bullish momentum. Given the absence of 1-hour timeframe data, a critical component for trend confirmation, and the conflicting short-term signals, there is no strong actionable BUY signal (Technical score not 4+). A SELL is not viable due to unprofitability. Therefore, the prudent action, adhering to the mandatory profitability rules, is to HOLD the existing position and await either a recovery to profitability or a clear stop-loss trigger.",

Price is supported above key moving averages with a bullish MACD crossover and positive histogram, signaling upward momentum. Critically, Williams %R and Stochastic K are deeply oversold, which, combined with the extremely high volume (34166x average) and the AI's HIGH confidence BULLISH trend prediction for a \"strong upward bounce,\" indicates a high probability of an imminent price surge. Holding this profitable position aligns with the aggressive trading mode's objective to maximize profit by riding the anticipated bullish continuation. Although the position exceeds the max shares per stock, it is an existing profitable holding which should be managed for maximum returns based on the strong bullish signals.",

Gross P&L is $-0.00, meaning no 2%+ loss has occurred. While the AI trend analysis indicates BULLISH sentiment with MEDIUM confidence, the underlying 5-minute technical indicators are largely neutral or conflicting. RSI is 50.0 (neutral), MACD Histogram, Line, and Signal are all 0.000 (indicating no clear momentum). While current volume is high at 5,000,000, the Volume MA, ATR, and 20-day Volatility are all 0.000, which suggests data inconsistencies and reduces confidence in sustained momentum or price movement. The lack of 1-hour data prevents comprehensive dual timeframe analysis for stronger trend confirmation. Given the ambiguity in technical signals and the mandatory unprofitable sell rule, the optimal action for the existing position is to HOLD and await clearer signals or a profitable exit point. New BUY action is not warranted as the aggregate technical score does not meet the \"4+\" aggressive BUY threshold.",

The AI trend analysis confirms this mixed picture, identifying a \"BULLISH\" trend but with \"LOW confidence\" and \"HIGH risk\" due to \"significant conflicting signals, warranting caution.\" While the aggressive trading mode encourages decisive action, the lack of clear directional conviction, coupled with strong conflicting momentum indicators and the AI's cautionary stance, dictates a HOLD.

Technical analysis shows mixed signals on the 5-minute timeframe: price is below bearishly aligned SMA 20 and SMA 50, and the AI trend analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with medium confidence, supported by high volume interpreted as selling pressure. However, momentum indicators like MACD Histogram (positive) and Stochastic K (79.9, near overbought) show some short-term bullish momentum. Given the absence of 1-hour timeframe data, a critical component for trend confirmation, and the conflicting short-term signals, there is no strong actionable BUY signal (Technical score not 4+).

While the AI trend analysis indicates BULLISH sentiment with MEDIUM confidence, the underlying 5-minute technical indicators are largely neutral or conflicting.

While current volume is high at 5,000,000, the Volume MA, ATR, and 20-day Volatility are all 0.000, which suggests data inconsistencies and reduces confidence in sustained momentum or price movement. The lack of 1-hour data prevents comprehensive dual timeframe analysis for stronger trend confirmation.

Therefore, the immediate action for the existing position must be HOLD. From a technical perspective, the 5-minute timeframe shows short-term bullish momentum with price above SMAs and a positive MACD crossover. However, this is heavily counterbalanced by extremely overbought conditions across all key momentum indicators: RSI is 90.9, Williams %R is -0.0, and Stochastic K is 100.0. In crypto, RSI > 80 signals are particularly strong for an imminent bearish correction. The AI Trend analysis confirms a BEARISH outlook with MEDIUM confidence and HIGH risk, explicitly citing this overextension as a signal for significant downside risk. The extremely high current volume (21M x average) further indicates significant activity which often precedes corrections at extreme levels. While these underlying technicals would strongly indicate a SELL for a new position due to the high probability of a bearish correction, the existing unprofitable position dictates a HOLD to avoid crystallizing losses and incurring fees, awaiting either a price recovery or a stop-loss trigger.

Crucially, current volume (77,795,975) is orders of magnitude above its moving average (Volume Ratio 716987.99x), strongly confirming heightened interest and validating the bullish move. While the MACD histogram and line suggest a bearish crossover or continuation, the overwhelming strength from volume and momentum, coupled with the AI's BULLISH trend analysis (medium confidence), justifies a BUY.

The existing position of 0.060413999999999995 shares, currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L $-0.01 after fees), will be held as per mandatory fee-aware sell rules; this BUY action is for adding new shares to capitalize on the strong upward momentum.

Despite an underlying bullish trend and high volume, key short-term momentum indicators (Stochastic K and Williams %R) are at 100, signaling extreme overbought conditions. The AI trend analysis explicitly warns of a \"consolidation phase with potential for a pullback\" due to these overbought indicators and current price flatness. In aggressive trading mode, it is crucial to maximize profit and accept higher risk, which includes taking decisive action to lock in gains when reversal signals are strong, especially when an explicit pullback warning is present. Selling now capitalizes on existing profits and avoids potential downside from a correction. The aggregated technical score of 3 also falls within the \"actionable for SELL\" range (6 or less).",

As per the mandatory fee-aware sell rules, I MUST recommend HOLD unless a stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here (Gross P&L is $0.00). While the AI trend analysis indicates a BULLISH trend with MEDIUM confidence due to positive momentum and high current volume, it also critically warns that the asset is \"currently overbought as indicated by Bollinger Bands, suggesting a potential short-term correction.\" This overbought condition, combined with a neutral RSI (50.0) and flat MACD (0.000), presents conflicting signals that do not support an aggressive new BUY entry at this moment. The price is above SMA 20 and SMA 50, which is positive, but the warning of an impending correction outweighs the immediate bullish momentum for new entries. Therefore, the primary action is to hold the existing unprofitable position and wait for either a clear price recovery to achieve profitability for a potential sell or a stronger, less ambiguous BUY signal for further accumulation.",

For new positions, while the 5-minute timeframe shows strong bullish momentum with price trading above key moving averages, a bullish MACD, and extremely high volume, all major momentum oscillators (RSI at 76.2, Stochastic K at 98.4, Williams %R at -1.6) are signaling extreme overbought conditions. The AI trend analysis explicitly warns of the current upward move being \"overextended and highly susceptible to an imminent pullback\" with a \"HIGH Risk\" level. Despite the aggressive trading mode prioritizing momentum, entering a new BUY position at this point carries a very high risk of immediate reversal and potential loss due to the overextension. My refined technical score is around 3.5, which falls below the '4+' threshold for an actionable BUY in aggressive mode, considering the strong warnings from the overbought oscillators. Therefore, it is prudent to HOLD and await either a healthy pullback or a clearer entry signal to maximize profit potential, aligning with the aggressive mode's goal of maximizing profit through decisive action, which includes avoiding high-risk entries at potential tops.",

The AI trend analysis confirms this, identifying an established bullish trend but warning of a high likelihood of a short-term pullback due to these overbought conditions, leading to a NEUTRAL trend assessment with HIGH risk. The lack of 1-hour data prevents medium-term confirmation. Given the conflicting strong momentum versus extreme overbought warnings, and the current technical score of 3.0 being below the actionable BUY threshold of 4+, a new BUY is not advisable, and selling the existing unprofitable position is prohibited.

While Williams %R (-20.1) and Stochastic K (79.9) suggest overbought conditions, indicating potential for short-term consolidation, the overwhelming bullish signals from AI, SMAs, MACD, and particularly the extreme volume, support a strong BUY action in an aggressive, momentum-driven strategy.

RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic are all in neutral territory, offering no strong directional signals. Furthermore, the extremely high volume ratio (716277.24x average) with no corresponding price movement is anomalous and suggests a data quality issue or a highly controlled, high-risk market environment. Crucially, I am unable to sell the existing position (0.10069 shares @ $2482.92) as it is currently unprofitable (Net P&L: -$0.01) after accounting for trading fees, directly violating the \"CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES\".

The AI trend analysis, despite its low confidence and high-risk assessment, points to a BULLISH trend. Price is consolidating slightly above key moving averages (SMA 20 and SMA 50), providing a support base. Furthermore, the anomalous high volume (34146.20x average) coinciding with a 0.00% daily price change suggests significant market activity that could precede a strong directional move, likely upwards given the oversold state. While the MACD shows a bearish crossover, in an AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, the strong oversold oscillators are prioritized for a high-risk, high-reward entry, anticipating a swift bounce to maximize profit. The current position is profitable, allowing for this aggressive entry.",

The 5-minute MACD and RSI are neutral, which doesn't provide strong momentum for either a buy or an immediate profitable exit.

Despite a strong daily price rally of +4.85% and extremely high current volume (23.8M x average), with the price trading above both 20 and 50-period SMAs, momentum indicators like MACD remain bearish (negative histogram and MACD line below signal). RSI is low at 30.9, but not in the extreme oversold zone to trigger a strong crypto-adjusted BUY signal (<20). The AI trend analysis explicitly rates the overall technical strength as \"NEUTRAL\" with \"MEDIUM\" confidence due to these conflicting underlying momentum indicators. The absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and reduces overall confidence in a strong directional trade. Under aggressive trading mode, clear technical scores (4+ for BUY, 6- for SELL) are required for decisive action; the current mixed signals do not meet these thresholds for a new position.

Momentum indicators like Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are very high, signaling strong upward pressure, which per crypto-adjusted rules, indicates powerful momentum. Crucially, the current volume is exceptionally high (77,789,945) at 712438.72x the average, providing strong confirmation for the bullish trend. The AI trend analysis also confirms a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. Although 1-hour data is unavailable, the 5-minute data provides an actionable, high-conviction BUY signal in line with the aggressive trading mode.

Crucially, current volume is an astonishing 34177.67x its average, providing overwhelming confirmation for the strength of this bullish move. While Williams %R and Stochastic K are extremely overbought indicating short-term overextension, RSI remains in a neutral-bullish zone (53.8). In this aggressive trading mode, prioritizing momentum and exceptional volume, these short-term overbought signals are outweighed by the strong underlying bullish trend.

There's positive price movement (+0.37%) and extremely high volume (5,000,000x average), which normally suggests strong bullish momentum. However, key short-term indicators like RSI (50.0) and MACD (0.000) are neutral, not confirming a strong buy signal. Crucially, the AI trend analysis, despite noting a BULLISH trend, explicitly warns of an \"overbought condition\" and a \"potential for a near-term pullback.\" Entering a new long position or adding to the existing one under these overbought conditions, with an explicit risk of pullback, would contradict the goal of maximizing profit and unnecessarily increase risk, especially while the current position is unprofitable. Lack of 1-hour data also reduces overall trend confidence.

The price is trading above both the SMA 20 ($2481.93) and SMA 50 ($2481.83), with a clear bullish crossover indicated by the MACD line (0.046) being above its signal line (0.019) and a positive, growing histogram (0.027). Momentum indicators like Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are very high, signaling strong upward pressure, which per crypto-adjusted rules, indicates powerful momentum. Crucially, the current volume is exceptionally high (77,789,945) at 712438.72x the average, providing strong confirmation for the bullish trend. The AI trend analysis also confirms a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. Although 1-hour data is unavailable, the 5-minute data provides an actionable, high-conviction BUY signal in line with the aggressive trading mode. The existing position is currently unprofitable to sell and therefore will be held as per fee-aware rules, while new shares are acquired to capitalize on the strong bullish trend.",

Crucially, current volume is an astonishing 34177.67x its average, providing overwhelming confirmation for the strength of this bullish move. While Williams %R and Stochastic K are extremely overbought indicating short-term overextension, RSI remains in a neutral-bullish zone (53.8). In this aggressive trading mode, prioritizing momentum and exceptional volume, these short-term overbought signals are outweighed by the strong underlying bullish trend.

Crucially, volume is exceptionally high (Volume Ratio: 31306966.95x average), which, combined with oversold conditions, provides a strong signal for a decisive aggressive entry based on momentum and volume prioritization.

In an aggressive trading mode, these strong oversold signals, combined with the underlying bullish price action and massive volume, suggest a high probability of an immediate upward bounce or reversal.

Critically, current volume is exceptionally high at 5,000,000, a staggering 5,000,000x its average, confirming strong buying pressure and robust momentum on a positive price day (+0.37%). The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this with a BULLISH trend and a bullish MACD signal. While the AI notes the price is above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating a potential overbought condition and the RSI is neutral (50.0), the aggressive strategy dictates leaning into strong volume-backed momentum. The lack of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a HIGH confidence rating, and the current position is unprofitable to sell (Net P&L After Fees: $-0.01), hence a BUY action will increase our exposure to this bullish momentum rather than exiting.",

Both Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are at extreme oversold levels. In an aggressive trading mode, these strong oversold signals, combined with the underlying bullish price action and massive volume, suggest a high probability of an immediate upward bounce or reversal. While the MACD shows a weak bearish crossover, the overwhelming momentum, oversold bounce potential, and profitable existing position warrant an aggressive BUY to capitalize on the expected rebound. The AI trend analysis also identifies the trend as BULLISH.",

The price ($577.66) is trading above both the SMA 20 ($575.53) and SMA 50 ($575.53), indicating upward momentum. Critically, current volume is exceptionally high at 5,000,000, a staggering 5,000,000x its average, confirming strong buying pressure and robust momentum on a positive price day (+0.37%). The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this with a BULLISH trend and a bullish MACD signal. While the AI notes the price is above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating a potential overbought condition and the RSI is neutral (50.0), the aggressive strategy dictates leaning into strong volume-backed momentum. The lack of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a HIGH confidence rating, and the current position is unprofitable to sell (Net P&L After Fees: $-0.01), hence a BUY action will increase our exposure to this bullish momentum rather than exiting.",

Despite the current price being static with 0.00% daily change and the AI trend analysis showing low confidence and high risk with neutral momentum indicators (RSI, Williams %R, Stochastic K), there are compelling bullish signals aligning with the aggressive trading mode. The MACD histogram (2.316) is positive, and the MACD line (0.288) is above the signal line (-2.028), indicating strong bullish momentum. The SMA 20 ($107770.10) is above the SMA 50 ($107764.71), confirming a bullish trend.

Technically, the 5-minute timeframe shows strong bearish signals from extremely overbought momentum indicators (Williams %R at -0.0 and Stochastic K at 100.0), suggesting potential downward pressure. The price is also below both the SMA 20 ($120.35) and SMA 50 ($120.36), further indicating short-term bearishness. While MACD shows a weak bullish crossover, the overall AI Trend Analysis indicates a 'WEAK_BEARISH' bias with 'LOW' confidence and 'HIGH' risk, citing indecision despite extremely high volume with no price change.

Analyzing the 5-minute timeframe, bullish signals include the current price ($577.66) being above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50 ($575.53), and an extremely high Current Volume (5,000,000) with a 5000000.00x volume ratio, indicating strong recent interest and potential for momentum. The AI trend analysis also identifies a BULLISH trend. However, there are cautionary signals: the MACD Histogram, Line, and Signal are flat at 0.000, suggesting a lack of strong immediate momentum, and the RSI (14) is neutral at 50.0. The AI trend confidence is LOW, citing ADX 0.0 (indicating a lack of overall trend strength) and warning of a potentially \"unsustainable upward move\" despite the bullish trend (it also mentions being overbought, which conflicts with the neutral RSI). The critical absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a higher-confidence assessment of the medium-term trend. Given the mixed technical signals, the aggressive mode's prioritization of momentum (supported by high volume) is present, but the overall lack of robust, confirmed upward momentum, combined with the mandatory HOLD for an unprofitable position, makes waiting for clearer direction or a return to profitability the most appropriate strategy.",

The current price ($107807.83) remains above both the 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages ($107764.71), indicating underlying short-term strength. Furthermore, the exceptionally high Volume Ratio (30720990.41x average) points to significant market interest and potential for upward momentum, crucial for aggressive entries. While MACD shows short-term bearish momentum (negative histogram and MACD line below signal), the overwhelming oversold conditions and strong volume outweigh this, suggesting a high-probability bounce play in line with the AI's \"BULLISH\" trend analysis. No news sentiment is available to alter this technical stance. *Note: The existing position for BTCUSD is currently unprofitable to sell due to trading fees, therefore, any existing position should be held.

Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) also show strong upward momentum, approaching but not yet in overbought territory by crypto standards. The AI Trend Analysis indicates a HIGH confidence BULLISH trend. Despite the absence of 1-hour data, the confluence of these strong 5-minute technicals, particularly the confirming volume, aligns perfectly with the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE to maximize profit and warrants an immediate BUY action to capitalize on the current uptrend.

Technical analysis shows conflicting short-term signals for new action: MACD has a bullish crossover, but Williams %R (-0.0) and Stochastic K (100.0) indicate extreme overbought conditions, suggesting a potential downward reversal, which is also supported by the AI's BEARISH trend assessment.

According to the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, an unprofitable position MUST be held unless an emergency stop-loss (2%+ loss) is triggered, which is not the case here. For new trade consideration, the technical analysis presents a mixed and low-confidence picture. While the price is above the 5-minute SMAs and the daily change is positive (+0.37%), the RSI is neutral (50.0), and MACD indicators are flat (0.000), indicating a lack of clear momentum. Critical 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, which significantly prevents trend confirmation and reduces overall confidence, as medium-term trends are weighted more heavily. The AI Trend Analysis confirms this, identifying a \"BULLISH\" trend but with \"LOW Confidence\" and \"HIGH Risk,\" specifically citing inconsistent or zero indicator data (e.g., Volume MA, ATR, Volatility). With no strong technical buy signals (technical score below 4+) and the inability to sell profitably, a HOLD action is mandatory for the existing position, and new entry is not justified.",

Technical analysis for the 5-minute timeframe shows a strong bearish bias: price ($120.30) is below both the SMA 20 ($120.35) and SMA 50 ($120.36), and the AI Trend analysis confirms a BEARISH outlook with MEDIUM confidence. Momentum indicators Williams %R (-0.0) and Stochastic K (100.0) are in extremely overbought territory, strongly suggesting an imminent downside correction or reversal. While the MACD histogram is slightly positive (0.001), the MACD line (-0.001) and signal (-0.003) are negative, and the overall picture, including the AI trend's reasoning, points to a strong downside risk. An extremely high volume ratio (34175.58x) with flat price action could indicate distribution or an impending significant move, which given the overbought momentum, is more likely to be to the downside.

With only 5-minute data available and no 1-hour trend confirmation, combined with the explicit overbought warning, the overall technical score falls below the actionable BUY threshold of 4+.

The MACD shows a clear bullish crossover with a positive histogram, and the price is firmly trading above both the SMA 20 ($2481.43) and SMA 50 ($2481.73), indicating a robust short-term uptrend. Momentum indicators like Williams %R (-20.1) and Stochastic K (79.9) are showing strong buying pressure, although not yet at extreme overbought levels for crypto, suggesting further upside potential. Crucially, the current volume is exceptionally high (710123.58x average), confirming the strength and conviction behind this upward movement. The AI trend analysis also confirms a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. Given the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE and the directive to MAXIMIZE PROFIT by accepting higher risk, adding to the current profitable position to capitalize on this strong momentum is warranted. We have ample room under the max shares constraint (0.26171 out of 5 shares) and sufficient cash.",

Furthermore, the AI Trend Analysis, despite calling the trend BULLISH, explicitly notes \"significant contradictions\" including \"0.00% daily change, absence of a defined trend (ADX=0), zero standard deviation, and bearish OBV,\" concluding it's a \"fragile or developing bullish trend.\" This mixed picture, particularly the lack of actual price movement despite high volume and overbought conditions, does not provide a clear enough \"technical score 4+\" for an aggressive BUY, nor a \"technical score 6-\" for a SELL. The most prudent action, consistent with aggressive mode's decisiveness and risk management, is to HOLD the existing position and wait for a clearer trend direction or for the current position to become profitable before considering a new trade.",

Critically, current volume is an astounding 34165.09x its average, signaling strong buying pressure and momentum. Although Williams %R and Stochastic K show extremely overbought conditions, the AI trend analysis explicitly states these are overridden by the overwhelming strength of the upward trend, which is a key consideration in aggressive crypto trading where strong momentum often pushes past traditional overbought levels.

While the price is slightly above flat SMAs ($577.66 > $575.53), suggesting a weak bullish bias, critical volatility metrics (ATR and 20-day Volatility) are zero, which is highly concerning and indicates a lack of price movement. Current volume is high (5,000,000), but without corresponding price movement or average volume for comparison, it does not confirm a strong trend. The AI trend analysis indicates 'BULLISH' but with 'LOW' confidence and 'HIGH' risk, specifically citing \"significant data gaps\" (e.g., no 1-hour data).

Momentum indicators are signaling overbought conditions, with Stochastic K at 81.8 (well above the crypto-adjusted threshold of 80 for strong overbought) and Williams %R at -18.2 (also in overbought territory), both suggesting an imminent price correction. Furthermore, the MACD has crossed bearishly (MACD Line 1.021 below Signal Line 3.306, with a negative MACD Histogram of -2.285). The AI trend analysis confirms a BEARISH outlook with MEDIUM confidence, attributing it to these overbought momentum indicators and the bearish MACD crossover, despite the current price being marginally above the SMA 20 and SMA 50. Volume is exceptionally high (Volume Ratio: 30638038.88x average), which could amplify any price movement. While the technical signals strongly indicate a SELL for new positions or if the existing position were profitable, the \"CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES\" dictate that a position showing \"\u274c UNPROFITABLE to sell\" (Net P&L After Fees: $-0.01) must be held unless it's an emergency stop-loss, which is not the case here. Therefore, we must HOLD the existing position, refraining from opening new long positions given the bearish outlook.",

Therefore, selling the current position is prohibited. Regarding potential new entries, the 5-minute timeframe shows the price above key moving averages (SMA 20 and SMA 50) and a positive daily change of +0.37%, supported by high current volume. However, the RSI is neutral at 50.0 and MACD indicators are flat at 0.000. Crucially, 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, which significantly impacts our ability to confirm medium-term trends and reduces overall confidence. The AI trend analysis indicates a \"BULLISH\" trend but with \"LOW Confidence\" and a \"HIGH Risk\" level, citing that the asset is \"significantly overbought\" and suggesting a potential short-term correction. Given the aggressive trading mode, a strong and clear signal across both momentum and trend is required for decisive action. The current mixed technicals, lack of 1-hour data, neutral momentum indicators, and the AI's \"overbought\" warning do not provide a sufficiently strong BUY signal (Technical Score not strongly >4) for a new entry. Without positive news as a strong confirmation, and considering the aggressive mode's emphasis on quick entry/exit based on strong signals, the prudent action for the existing unprofitable position is to HOLD and await a more definitive breakout or recovery towards profitability.",

In Aggressive Trading Mode, with the goal to maximize profit and be quick to exit, selling a profitable, overextended position at potential peak (due to overbought signals) is a decisive action to lock in gains and manage risk, especially given the portfolio constraints.",

Per mandatory trading rules, the existing position must be HELD until it becomes profitable or triggers a stop-loss. For new trades, while the 5-minute timeframe shows a weak bullish trend with the price above SMAs and exceptionally high volume (5,000,000), indicating some momentum, the AI trend analysis explicitly states \"LOW Confidence\" and \"HIGH Risk\" due to being \"overbought per Bollinger Bands\" with a potential pullback. The RSI is neutral (50.0) and MACD is at zero, not confirming a strong upward breakout. Given the absence of 1-hour data for trend confirmation and the conflicting signals (bullish trend vs. high risk/low confidence), the technical strength does not meet the \"4+\" threshold for an aggressive BUY, despite the high volume. Therefore, the recommendation is to HOLD the existing position and await clearer, stronger bullish confirmation without the high risk warning before considering adding to the position or for the price to move into a profitable zone for selling.",

While Stochastic K (90.9) and Williams %R (-9.1) indicate heavily overbought conditions suggesting a potential near-term reversal or pullback, the aggressive trading strategy prioritizes maximizing profit through decisive action, accepting higher risk for higher potential returns by capitalizing on strong, confirmed momentum.

The AI trend analysis, despite being BULLISH, has LOW confidence and explicitly notes that this \"weak bullishness is at risk of consolidation or reversal\" due to the overbought conditions.

The AI Trend Analysis confirms a NEUTRAL trend with HIGH confidence, despite extremely high current volume (77,666,039) compared to its MA (109). This suggests consolidation without a clear directional breakout. No 1-hour data is available for medium-term trend confirmation.

Furthermore, a SELL action is prohibited as the current position is explicitly marked as \"\u274c UNPROFITABLE to sell\" (Net P&L $-0.01) and does not meet the 2%+ stop-loss trigger. Therefore, per mandatory trading rules, HOLD is the only permissible action.",

Both Williams %R at -20.0 and Stochastic K at 80.0 are in overbought territory, which in an aggressive crypto trading context signifies robust momentum rather than an immediate reversal. Crucially, the current volume is exceptionally high, with a Volume Ratio of 31319722.28x average, indicating significant market interest and strong conviction behind the upward move, which is a primary focus for aggressive trading. The AI Trend Analysis also confirms a BULLISH outlook with medium confidence. While 1-hour data is unavailable, limiting medium-term trend confirmation, the overwhelming short-term momentum and volume signals justify a decisive BUY. Although the current small position is unprofitable to sell, this recommendation is to capitalize on the strong upward momentum by adding to the position, aligning with the aggressive mode's objective to maximize profit by accepting higher risk in pursuit of higher returns.",

Critically, the current volume is extraordinarily high (717677.61x the average), which is a powerful confirmation of strong buying interest and momentum, a key factor in aggressive trading. The AI trend analysis further reinforces this by identifying a BULLISH trend with medium confidence.

Therefore, an immediate SELL is not permissible, and the position must be held. For new trades, the 5-minute analysis presents conflicting signals. While momentum oscillators Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are extremely oversold, indicating a high potential for an upward reversal (a strong aggressive BUY signal in crypto), the MACD histogram (-0.004), MACD line (-0.005), and price ($120.30) trading below both SMA 20 ($120.36) and SMA 50 ($120.36) indicate a short-term bearish trend. The AI Trend Analysis confirms a \"BEARISH\" trend with \"MEDIUM\" confidence, noting \"high volume on negative price movement\" further indicating selling pressure, despite acknowledging the potential for reversals from oversold indicators. Without 1-hour data to confirm a higher timeframe trend, and with the AI's primary assessment being bearish, the mixed technical signals do not provide a strong enough technical score (below 4+) to initiate a new BUY order, even in aggressive mode. Thus, holding the current position and awaiting clearer directional signals or price recovery is the appropriate action.",

The 5-minute data shows the price above SMAs, which is bullish, but RSI and MACD are neutral (0.000). Volume and volatility indicators are unreliable or zero. The AI trend analysis, while labeling the trend BULLISH, has LOW confidence and explicitly warns of an \"overbought condition\" signaling a potential pullback.

However, the price is currently holding above the 20 and 50-period Simple Moving Averages, and the AI confidence is low. High volume suggests active trading, but the direction remains ambiguous without 1-hour confirmation.

While there are minor bullish signals from the MACD (line above signal, slightly positive histogram) and price position relative to SMAs (above SMA20 and SMA50), key momentum indicators like RSI, Stochastic K, and Williams %R are all neutral (~50). The extremely high current volume relative to its moving average, without any price movement, suggests a lack of clear directional conviction or strong momentum, which is critical for aggressive trading. Under AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, the absence of strong, discernible momentum negates immediate high-profit entry opportunities. Furthermore, the current position is \u274c UNPROFITABLE to sell, with a net P&L of $-0.26, which is well below the 2% stop-loss threshold. As per the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, an unprofitable position cannot be sold unless it triggers a stop-loss.

According to mandatory fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position must be held unless a stop-loss is hit. Technical analysis for a new trade shows a conflicted market: short-term trend indicators (MACD, price below SMAs) are bearish, but momentum oscillators (Williams %R, Stochastic K) are deeply oversold, suggesting a potential bounce. The AI trend analysis is bearish with low confidence, indicating high uncertainty. Extremely high volume with flat price adds to the ambiguity.

This is further supported by the current price ($2482.92) maintaining above both the 20-period ($2481.93) and 50-period ($2482.08) Simple Moving Averages, suggesting short-term upward strength. While the MACD exhibits a bearish signal (histogram below zero and MACD line below signal line), the overwhelming volume and price action above key moving averages counterbalance this, particularly under an aggressive strategy that prioritizes momentum. The existing position is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L: $-0.26), making a BUY action strategically aligned to potentially capitalize on the indicated momentum or average down the position. The absence of 1-hour data limits long-term trend confirmation, resulting in a Medium confidence.",

Given the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, the strong momentum indicators (MACD, Volume) and the bullish trend (price above SMAs) outweigh the neutral oscillators and missing longer-term data for a new entry, pushing the technical score above the actionable BUY threshold (4+).

Technical analysis shows mixed signals: Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are extremely oversold, often preceding a bounce. However, MACD is weakly bearish, and the price is below the 5-minute SMAs, indicating short-term bearish pressure. The AI trend analysis confirms \"extreme consolidation\" with \"no clear trend\" and highlights \"bearish price action on high volume\" despite \"strongly oversold momentum indicators.\" The massive volume spike (34337.83x average) suggests a potential significant move or capitulation, but without clear direction, it supports waiting. Given the aggressive mode, holding allows for a potential recovery to profitability based on the oversold conditions before considering an exit, as a premature, unprofitable sell would contradict the maximize profit objective.

This signals a high risk of a short-term reversal or significant pullback. The AI trend analysis also identifies a BULLISH trend but with LOW confidence and HIGH risk due to these overbought conditions. Given the aggressive trading mode, entering a new BUY under these mixed technicals with strong overbought warnings and no 1-hour data for broader trend confirmation is not advisable, and selling the existing unprofitable position is prohibited by the rules.",

According to critical fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position that is not at a stop-loss trigger MUST be held. Technically, the 5-minute timeframe presents a bearish leaning. Price ($2480.44) is trading below bearishly crossed moving averages (SMA20 $2482.18 < SMA50 $2482.23), and momentum oscillators such as Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are nearing overbought levels, indicating potential for a downward reversal. The AI Trend Analysis also reports a BEARISH trend with medium confidence, further supported by significant negative price movement amplified by extremely high volume (716852.08x average). While the MACD shows a bullish crossover, it is contradicted by stronger, more immediate bearish signals from SMAs and momentum oscillators. Given these factors, a new BUY is not justified (technical score below 4+), and a SELL is prohibited for the existing unprofitable position.",

Crucially, volume is exceptionally high (34208.58x average), signifying strong buying interest and confirmation of the bullish trend, which is a key priority in aggressive trading. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this with a HIGH confidence BULLISH outlook, attributing the oversold momentum indicators (Williams %R -96.1, Stochastic K 3.9) as supporting a strong upward bias (potential for a bounce from a short-term dip within an uptrend). Despite missing 1-hour data, the overwhelming strength in the 5-minute timeframe, especially the extreme volume and clear price/MACD alignment, warrants an aggressive BUY.

Per mandatory fee-aware sell rules, we MUST recommend HOLD for this position as it is not a 2%+ stop-loss trigger. For potential new trades, the technical analysis is significantly hampered by unreliable underlying data. While the price shows a slight positive daily change (+0.37%) and is above the 5-minute SMAs, key momentum and volatility indicators are either neutral (RSI 50.0, MACD at 0.000) or outright unreliable/missing (Williams %R, Stochastic K are 'nan', ATR is 0.000 despite price movement, Volume MA is 0 making Volume Ratio misleading). The AI trend analysis confirms a 'BULLISH' trend but with 'LOW' confidence and 'HIGH' risk, explicitly stating \"unreliable underlying data for several key indicators introduce significant uncertainty.\" Given these data integrity issues, even with a calculated technical score that might otherwise suggest a buy, the lack of reliable signals prevents a confident entry or adding to the position. Aggressive mode requires decisive action on strong signals, but unreliable data constitutes a fundamental lack of clear signals. Therefore, the overall recommendation is to HOLD until clearer and more reliable market data emerges to form an actionable trading signal.",

As per critical fee-aware sell rule #4, the existing position MUST be held unless a stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here. For new trading opportunities, the technical signals on the 5-minute timeframe are conflicting. Price is currently above both the SMA 20 ($107764.71) and SMA 50 ($107771.18), with a positive daily change of +0.10%, which are bullish short-term indicators. Furthermore, the Current Volume is exceptionally high at 78,096,352, with a Volume Ratio of 31461203.63x average, indicating significant market activity. However, the MACD Histogram (-10.226) and MACD Line are below the Signal Line, indicating bearish momentum. Oscillators like RSI (50.0), Williams %R (-40.0), and Stochastic K (60.0) are all in neutral territory. The AI trend analysis explicitly states a 'NEUTRAL' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence and 'HIGH' risk, directly citing these \"conflicting signals and a lack of clear direction.\" Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of any sustained medium-term trend and reduces overall confidence, as per the dual timeframe instruction to weight 1-hour trends more heavily. Given the aggressive trading mode prioritizes momentum and volume, the conflict between high volume (suggesting potential movement) and bearish MACD (suggesting downward momentum) combined with neutral oscillators and AI's neutral trend means there is no sufficiently strong and confirmed directional signal (neither 4+ for BUY nor 6- for SELL) to justify initiating a new aggressive trade at this time. Therefore, the recommendation is to HOLD the existing position and await clearer directional signals before considering new entries.",

As per mandatory trading rules, an unprofitable position must be HELD unless a stop-loss is hit. Supporting this, the AI Trend Analysis indicates a NEUTRAL trend with HIGH confidence due to an extremely flat market (0.00% daily change, zero ADX). While the 5-minute MACD shows a bullish crossover and current volume is exceptionally high (708055.89x average), these are contradicted by the price trading below both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, and both Stochastic K (80.0) and Williams %R (-20.0) indicating overbought conditions.

Critically, in this AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, the current volume is extraordinarily high with a Volume Ratio of 31556224.57x average, signaling significant momentum and market interest, which is a primary driver for a BUY decision. While the MACD shows a strong bearish cross with a negative histogram (MACD Line -13.215, Signal -2.774), presenting a conflicting signal and inherent risk, the dominant momentum and bullish price action above key moving averages warrant a BUY. The existing position of 0.00649492 shares is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L After Fees: -$0.008), therefore, per mandatory rules, this specific position must be HELD.

As per the critical fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position must be held unless an emergency stop-loss is triggered. Technically, the 5-minute data presents mixed signals. The AI Trend Analysis indicates a 'BEARISH' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence, citing the price trading below key moving averages and negative daily change, suggesting underlying selling pressure. This is reinforced by the current price of $2480.44 being below both SMA 20 ($2482.05) and SMA 50 ($2482.28). However, short-term momentum indicators like MACD Histogram (0.161), Williams %R (-20.1), and Stochastic K (79.9) all suggest recent upward momentum or are nearing overbought levels, indicating short-term buying pressure or a potential bounce. Volume is exceptionally high (715134.75x average), confirming significant market activity, though its overall directional impact is ambiguous given the conflicting signals. With no 1-hour data available and no news sentiment, the decision is primarily driven by the mandatory rule to hold unprofitable positions that are not at an emergency stop-loss, while acknowledging the conflicting technical forces at play.",

Moving Averages (SMA 20 at $120.37 above SMA 50 at $120.36) show bullish alignment. Momentum indicators like Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are deeply oversold, which, according to crypto-adjusted risk management, are strong BUY signals suggesting a potential bullish reversal or breakout. Critically, the current volume is exceptionally high (34142.89x average), indicating strong market interest and supporting an imminent upward price movement, which aligns with the aggressive mode's prioritization of momentum and volume. The AI Trend Analysis also confirms a BULLISH outlook with MEDIUM confidence. While the MACD shows a slight bearish crossover, its values are near zero, indicating weak momentum and is significantly outweighed by the other strong bullish indicators. Given the aggressive trading mode's objective to maximize profit and the robust bullish signals, holding the profitable position is recommended to capitalize on the anticipated upside.

From a technical analysis perspective, the 5-minute timeframe shows the current price ($577.66) is above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50 ($575.53), indicating a short-term bullish bias. Momentum is strong, highlighted by the exceptionally high current volume (5,000,000) and volume ratio (5000000.00x average), which aligns with the aggressive trading mode's prioritization of momentum indicators. The AI Trend Analysis confirms a BULLISH trend with Medium Confidence, reasoning that price is above key moving averages supported by strong volume. However, the AI also notes an overbought condition, and other indicators like RSI (50.0) and MACD (neutral) are not strongly bullish. The absence of 1-hour data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe assessment. Despite the underlying bullish momentum, the position must be held to await a price increase that yields a net profitable exit.",

Critically, in this AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, the current volume is extraordinarily high with a Volume Ratio of 31556224.57x average, signaling significant momentum and market interest, which is a primary driver for a BUY decision. While the MACD shows a strong bearish cross with a negative histogram (MACD Line -13.215, Signal -2.774), presenting a conflicting signal and inherent risk, the dominant momentum and bullish price action above key moving averages warrant a BUY. The existing position of 0.00649492 shares is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L After Fees: -$0.008), therefore, per mandatory rules, this specific position must be HELD.

Price is currently trading above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating weak short-term bullishness, and this is supported by extremely high volume, which signifies strong market activity. However, the MACD shows a clear bearish crossover, a reliable and strong bearish signal for crypto markets. Other momentum indicators like RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic are perfectly neutral. The AI trend analysis confirms this mixed picture, identifying a \"BULLISH\" trend but with \"LOW confidence\" and \"HIGH risk\" due to \"significant conflicting signals, warranting caution.\" While the aggressive trading mode encourages decisive action, the lack of clear directional conviction, coupled with strong conflicting momentum indicators and the AI's cautionary stance, dictates a HOLD.

Technical analysis shows mixed signals on the 5-minute timeframe: price is below bearishly aligned SMA 20 and SMA 50, and the AI trend analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with medium confidence, supported by high volume interpreted as selling pressure. However, momentum indicators like MACD Histogram (positive) and Stochastic K (79.9, near overbought) show some short-term bullish momentum. Given the absence of 1-hour timeframe data, a critical component for trend confirmation, and the conflicting short-term signals, there is no strong actionable BUY signal (Technical score not 4+). A SELL is not viable due to unprofitability. Therefore, the prudent action, adhering to the mandatory profitability rules, is to HOLD the existing position and await either a recovery to profitability or a clear stop-loss trigger.",

Critically, Williams %R and Stochastic K are deeply oversold, which, combined with the extremely high volume (34166x average) and the AI's HIGH confidence BULLISH trend prediction for a \"strong upward bounce,\" indicates a high probability of an imminent price surge. Holding this profitable position aligns with the aggressive trading mode's objective to maximize profit by riding the anticipated bullish continuation.

Gross P&L is $-0.00, meaning no 2%+ loss has occurred. While the AI trend analysis indicates BULLISH sentiment with MEDIUM confidence, the underlying 5-minute technical indicators are largely neutral or conflicting. RSI is 50.0 (neutral), MACD Histogram, Line, and Signal are all 0.000 (indicating no clear momentum). While current volume is high at 5,000,000, the Volume MA, ATR, and 20-day Volatility are all 0.000, which suggests data inconsistencies and reduces confidence in sustained momentum or price movement. The lack of 1-hour data prevents comprehensive dual timeframe analysis for stronger trend confirmation. Given the ambiguity in technical signals and the mandatory unprofitable sell rule, the optimal action for the existing position is to HOLD and await clearer signals or a profitable exit point.
