Critically, in this AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, the current volume is extraordinarily high with a Volume Ratio of 31556224.57x average, signaling significant momentum and market interest, which is a primary driver for a BUY decision. While the MACD shows a strong bearish cross with a negative histogram (MACD Line -13.215, Signal -2.774), presenting a conflicting signal and inherent risk, the dominant momentum and bullish price action above key moving averages warrant a BUY. The existing position of 0.00649492 shares is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L After Fees: -$0.008), therefore, per mandatory rules, this specific position must be HELD. This BUY recommendation is for initiating a new trade to capitalize on the identified bullish momentum.",N/A,107807.83,50.0,sim_1756020719,Submitted,0.00046379,0,0,0.000108,2025-08-24,0.0,950.0,55
