While short-term indicators like Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) show extreme oversold conditions, suggesting a potential bullish rebound, the overall technical picture is mixed and lacks strong conviction. The price is stagnant (+0.00% daily change), and MACD shows a very slight bearish momentum, albeit with minimal values. Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirming a medium-term trend and significantly reduces overall confidence, as highlighted by the AI trend analysis (BULLISH, but LOW Confidence). Under aggressive trading rules, where technical scores 6- are actionable for SELL, and with our calculated technical score of 5.5 (which falls within this range), combined with the absence of higher-timeframe confirmation, taking profit on a current position aligns with being quick to enter/exit and managing risk in ambiguous scenarios.",N/A,120.42,49.99994946,sim_1755782278,Submitted,0.415213,0,0,0.000142,2025-08-21,0.0,1049.99994946,1
