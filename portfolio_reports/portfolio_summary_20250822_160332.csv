While a new SELL order would be indicated by the strong bearish technicals (MACD bearish, price below bearishly aligned SMAs, Stochastic K 80 and Williams %R -20 signaling potential overbought reversal into a bearish trend, and AI classifying as ""STRONG_BEARISH""), no new BUY action is justified. The extremely high volume ratio with a flat 0.00% daily price change, coupled with the bearish indicators, suggests potential distribution or consolidation before a further decline.

The current price is also holding above key Short-term Moving Averages (SMA 20 & SMA 50).
