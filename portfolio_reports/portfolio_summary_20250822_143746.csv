Multiple key momentum indicators, Williams %R (-1.0) and Stochastic K (99.0), are flashing extreme overbought conditions, strongly indicating an imminent price reversal to the downside. This is further reinforced by a bearish MACD crossover (MACD Line -6.609 is below Signal -6.172) and a negative MACD histogram, confirming bearish momentum. The AI trend analysis also identifies a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence, specifically citing these overbought conditions and the MACD crossover. Despite current price being above SMAs, the overwhelming short-term momentum divergence and the high volume suggest a potential blow-off top.

However, crucial momentum indicators like RSI (50.0) and MACD (0.000) are neutral, and the AI trend analysis, despite identifying a BULLISH trend, assigns LOW confidence and a HIGH risk level.

Furthermore, no 1-hour data is available, preventing a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and trend confirmation, which is critical for strong directional conviction.
