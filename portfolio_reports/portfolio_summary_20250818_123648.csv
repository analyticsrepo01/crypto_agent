The AI trend analysis confirms a high-confidence bearish outlook. However, multiple short-term momentum indicators, including RSI (38.9), Williams %R (-98.5), and Stochastic K/D (1.5/9.7), show extremely oversold conditions, and the price is currently at the lower Bollinger Band. While the underlying trend remains negative, initiating a SELL trade at these extreme oversold levels carries a high risk of an immediate short-term bounce. In Balanced Trading Mode, which prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators for ideal entry, selling into an oversold market is not advisable.

In a BALANCED TRADING MODE, capital preservation is prioritized, demanding a technical score of 6+ for high-priority BUYs, multiple confirming indicators, and strong technical alignment.
