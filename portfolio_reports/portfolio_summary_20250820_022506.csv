However, the MACD line has crossed below its signal line, indicating weakening momentum and a potential short-term bearish divergence. Furthermore, the AI analysis explicitly points to overbought conditions and an increased risk of a pullback. While the underlying trend is bullish, these strong short-term bearish signals (MACD, overbought status) create significant conflicting indicators, suggesting it's not an opportune time for a new long entry. It is prudent to wait for either a clear bullish reversal from the MACD or a pullback to a more favorable entry point.

The current price ($2480.44) is consistently below both the SMA 20 ($2481.80) and SMA 50 ($2481.88), with the SMA 20 also having crossed below the SMA 50, indicating a clear downtrend. MACD histogram is negative (-0.062), and the MACD line (-0.127) is below its signal line (-0.065), confirming bearish momentum. The RSI (44.4) is below 50, showing a bearish bias. The AI trend analysis confirms a HIGH confidence BEARISH trend, citing these moving average and MACD indicators, further supported by exceptionally high volume (Volume Ratio: 715442.02x average) which confirms strong selling pressure. As no 1-hour timeframe data is available, the robust 5-minute analysis and high-confidence AI trend are the primary drivers.

Williams %R at -100.0 and Stochastic K at 0.0 both indicate extreme oversold conditions, which are highly potent buy signals in crypto, suggesting an imminent bounce or upward correction. This is strongly reinforced by a bullish MACD crossover (MACD Line 0.085 is above Signal Line 0.055, with a positive Histogram of 0.030), confirming building positive momentum. Despite a slight daily price decline of -0.10%, the current volume is extraordinarily high (34024.16x average), which often accompanies significant price reversals as strong buying pressure enters the market. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates a BULLISH outlook with MEDIUM confidence. While 1-hour data is unavailable, the confluence of multiple, crypto-adjusted oversold momentum indicators and a bullish MACD crossover provides robust technical evidence for a BUY.
