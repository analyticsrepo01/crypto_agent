Both Stochastic K (81.8) and Williams %R (-18.2) are in overbought territory, signaling a high probability of a downward reversal. Furthermore, the AI Trend Analysis is unequivocally BEARISH with HIGH confidence, explicitly citing these momentum indicators, coupled with the extremely high current volume (78,026,064 vs. MA 3) indicating strong underlying selling pressure.
