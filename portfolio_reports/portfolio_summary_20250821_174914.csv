The current price ($107700.02) is below both the SMA 20 ($107780.88) and SMA 50 ($107764.71), indicating a clear downtrend. The MACD shows a bearish crossover with the MACD line (-6.121) below its signal line (2.224), and the MACD Histogram (-8.344) is negative, reinforcing strong negative momentum. Both Williams %R (-9.5) and Stochastic K (90.5) are deep in overbought territory, signaling an imminent reversal downwards, which is a stronger sell signal in crypto (>80 for Stochastic K). The AI trend analysis confirms a ""BEARISH"" trend with ""HIGH"" confidence, explicitly citing price below MAs, bearish crossovers, and overbought momentum indicators signaling declines. The exceptionally high current volume (78,801,269) relative to its moving average (Volume Ratio: 31439449.35x) further validates the significant bearish price movement.
