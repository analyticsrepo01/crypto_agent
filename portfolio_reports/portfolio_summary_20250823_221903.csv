For new positions, while the 5-minute timeframe shows strong bullish momentum with price trading above key moving averages, a bullish MACD, and extremely high volume, all major momentum oscillators (RSI at 76.2, Stochastic K at 98.4, Williams %R at -1.6) are signaling extreme overbought conditions. The AI trend analysis explicitly warns of the current upward move being ""overextended and highly susceptible to an imminent pullback"" with a ""HIGH Risk"" level. Despite the aggressive trading mode prioritizing momentum, entering a new BUY position at this point carries a very high risk of immediate reversal and potential loss due to the overextension. My refined technical score is around 3.5, which falls below the '4+' threshold for an actionable BUY in aggressive mode, considering the strong warnings from the overbought oscillators. Therefore, it is prudent to HOLD and await either a healthy pullback or a clearer entry signal to maximize profit potential, aligning with the aggressive mode's goal of maximizing profit through decisive action, which includes avoiding high-risk entries at potential tops.",3.0,MEDIUM,BULLISH,MEDIUM,HIGH,76.20456575354044,104217.689,106203.2252,727.3416779799327,0.0,18405731.41980309,AGGRESSIVE
