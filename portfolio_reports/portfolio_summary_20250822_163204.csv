While MACD shows a minor bearish crossover with negligible values, and RSI is neutral, these are outweighed by the strong oversold momentum and exceptional volume. The AI trend analysis also concludes 'BULLISH' with medium confidence, based on these factors. This action aligns with maximizing profit by capitalizing on a potential bounce from oversold levels.
