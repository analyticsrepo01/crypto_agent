In an aggressive trading mode aimed at maximizing profit, entering a position in a perfectly flat market with zero volatility would only incur trading fees ($0.01 per trade) without any potential for price appreciation or depreciation, directly contradicting the objective to maximize profit and accept risk for *potential* returns. Therefore, despite a technical score of 5 which nominally falls within 'actionable for BUY' (4+) and 'actionable for SELL' (6-), the complete lack of movement and contradictory data renders any trade attempt unprofitable and highly uncertain.
