For potential new trades, the technical analysis is severely compromised by the extremely static price data (0.00% daily change), which renders many indicators unreliable. While 5-minute MACD and SMA are bearish, Stochastic and Williams %R are neutral to overbought, creating conflicting signals. Crucially, there is no 1-hour data available to confirm any medium-term trend, which is a critical component for weighting in our analysis. The AI's low confidence in the trend due to data anomalies supports a cautious approach. Despite being in AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, taking new positions or selling at a loss on such unreliable and contradictory data would be irrational and detrimental to profit maximization.",

Furthermore, despite some underlying bearish structural alignment from MACD (-0.039 MACD Line vs -0.030 Signal, -0.008 Histogram) and price trading below both SMA 20 ($2481.80) and SMA 50 ($2481.93), the 5-minute data shows an absolute 0.00% daily price change. The AI trend analysis unequivocally states a \"NEUTRAL\" trend with \"HIGH\" confidence due to a complete lack of current volatility and no discernible price movement (ADX 0, zero standard deviation). The extremely high volume (77,897,954) without any price movement suggests market stagnation rather than active trend. There is no news available to provide a directional catalyst. Given the mandatory hold rule for unprofitable positions and the complete lack of market momentum, holding is the only permissible and prudent action.",

Volatility (ATR and 20-day Volatility) is also zero. The AI trend analysis confirms a \"NEUTRAL\" trend with \"HIGH\" confidence due to this stagnation. While current volume is high (5,000,000), the lack of any price movement suggests this is not indicative of momentum or a developing trend. Crucially, no 1-hour data is available, preventing the primary instruction to weight medium-term trends more heavily and severely limiting the ability to confirm a directional bias. As such, there is no actionable technical signal (score 4+) to initiate a BUY in line with the aggressive trading mode, which requires clear momentum and technical strength. Without any directional bias or catalyst, the optimal action is to hold and await clearer signals.",

Selling at a loss is strictly prohibited unless a 2%+ stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case at the current price of $120.30 ($120.33 purchase price). Technically, the market exhibits extreme stagnation with a 0.00% daily change and low volatility (ATR 0.120). Despite this, momentum oscillators (Williams %R at -0.0 and Stochastic K at 100.0) are severely overbought on the 5-minute timeframe, suggesting a bearish bias or impending consolidation/reversal. Price is marginally below the 20 and 50 SMA ($120.36), which is a slight bearish indicator. MACD shows a weak bullish crossover but with very low values, indicating little directional conviction. A massive volume spike (33565x average) is observed, suggesting significant activity, yet without clear price direction, which is characteristic of accumulation/distribution in a tight range. No 1-hour data is available, preventing medium-term trend confirmation and reducing overall confidence. Given the UNPROFITABLE status, and mixed technicals leaning bearish but not triggering a stop-loss, holding is the only permissible action as per the trading rules, awaiting price recovery or a clearer directional signal.",

According to the \"CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES,\" I am mandated to HOLD an unprofitable position unless a 2%+ stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here. From a technical perspective, while the 5-minute timeframe shows bullish signs with price trading above key moving averages ($577.66 vs SMA 20/50 at $575.53), positive daily change (+0.37%), and extremely high volume (5,000,000x average), the AI analysis notes an overbought condition above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating potential for a short-term pullback. Crucially, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data significantly hinders comprehensive trend confirmation, reducing overall confidence. Many momentum indicators (RSI 50.0, MACD 0.000) are neutral or missing (Williams %R, Stochastic), and there is no news sentiment to provide further confirmation. The calculated technical score is 3, which is below the aggressive mode's threshold of 4+ for a BUY action. Given the combination of an unprofitable position preventing a sell and insufficient bullish conviction (due to missing data and overbought short-term signals) for a buy, HOLD is the appropriate action.",

Technical indicators on the 5-minute timeframe are largely neutral; RSI is at 50.0 and MACD values are near zero. While the current price is slightly above the SMA 20 and SMA 50, and there's high current volume, the overall daily change is minimal (+0.13%). The lack of 1-hour data and inconsistencies in volatility metrics (ATR, 20-day Volatility, Volume MA all at 0) severely limit comprehensive analysis and reduce confidence. The AI trend analysis indicates a \"BULLISH\" trend but with \"LOW confidence\" and notes data inconsistencies. Without strong bullish momentum to justify buying more, or a clear bearish signal/stop-loss trigger to sell, holding the current position and waiting for clearer price action or profitability is the most prudent strategy.",

The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, classifying the trend as NEUTRAL with HIGH confidence and LOW risk (due to no volatility). In AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, we prioritize momentum and clear technical signals (4+ for BUY, 6- for SELL). With all indicators at equilibrium and no discernible trend or volatility, there is no actionable signal to enter a position for profit maximization, nor is there any news sentiment to sway the decision.

Volatility (ATR and 20-day Volatility) is also zero. The AI trend analysis confirms a \"NEUTRAL\" trend with \"HIGH\" confidence due to this stagnation. While current volume is high (5,000,000), the lack of any price movement suggests this is not indicative of momentum or a developing trend. Crucially, no 1-hour data is available, preventing the primary instruction to weight medium-term trends more heavily and severely limiting the ability to confirm a directional bias. As such, there is no actionable technical signal (score 4+) to initiate a BUY in line with the aggressive trading mode, which requires clear momentum and technical strength.

Selling at a loss is strictly prohibited unless a 2%+ stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case at the current price of $120.30 ($120.33 purchase price). Technically, the market exhibits extreme stagnation with a 0.00% daily change and low volatility (ATR 0.120). Despite this, momentum oscillators (Williams %R at -0.0 and Stochastic K at 100.0) are severely overbought on the 5-minute timeframe, suggesting a bearish bias or impending consolidation/reversal. Price is marginally below the 20 and 50 SMA ($120.36), which is a slight bearish indicator. MACD shows a weak bullish crossover but with very low values, indicating little directional conviction. A massive volume spike (33565x average) is observed, suggesting significant activity, yet without clear price direction, which is characteristic of accumulation/distribution in a tight range. No 1-hour data is available, preventing medium-term trend confirmation and reducing overall confidence. Given the UNPROFITABLE status, and mixed technicals leaning bearish but not triggering a stop-loss, holding is the only permissible action as per the trading rules, awaiting price recovery or a clearer directional signal.",

According to the \"CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES,\" I am mandated to HOLD an unprofitable position unless a 2%+ stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here. From a technical perspective, while the 5-minute timeframe shows bullish signs with price trading above key moving averages ($577.66 vs SMA 20/50 at $575.53), positive daily change (+0.37%), and extremely high volume (5,000,000x average), the AI analysis notes an overbought condition above the upper Bollinger Band, indicating potential for a short-term pullback. Crucially, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data significantly hinders comprehensive trend confirmation, reducing overall confidence. Many momentum indicators (RSI 50.0, MACD 0.000) are neutral or missing (Williams %R, Stochastic), and there is no news sentiment to provide further confirmation. The calculated technical score is 3, which is below the aggressive mode's threshold of 4+ for a BUY action. Given the combination of an unprofitable position preventing a sell and insufficient bullish conviction (due to missing data and overbought short-term signals) for a buy, HOLD is the appropriate action.",

Technical indicators on the 5-minute timeframe are largely neutral; RSI is at 50.0 and MACD values are near zero. While the current price is slightly above the SMA 20 and SMA 50, and there's high current volume, the overall daily change is minimal (+0.13%). The lack of 1-hour data and inconsistencies in volatility metrics (ATR, 20-day Volatility, Volume MA all at 0) severely limit comprehensive analysis and reduce confidence. The AI trend analysis indicates a \"BULLISH\" trend but with \"LOW confidence\" and notes data inconsistencies. Without strong bullish momentum to justify buying more, or a clear bearish signal/stop-loss trigger to sell, holding the current position and waiting for clearer price action or profitability is the most prudent strategy.",

Despite this mandatory HOLD, the underlying technical analysis presents a predominantly bearish outlook. The AI trend analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence, citing price consistently below key moving averages and negative price movement confirmed by high volume. Short-term momentum indicators, Williams %R (-0.0) and Stochastic K (100.0), are heavily overbought, strongly suggesting potential for downside reversal. While the 5-minute MACD shows a short-term bullish crossover (MACD Line 2.919 > Signal -0.740), this is outweighed by the overall bearish trend, overbought conditions, and price action relative to SMAs. Extreme volume confirms significant market activity, which the AI attributes to bearish movement.

Per critical fee-aware sell rule #4, a HOLD recommendation is mandatory in this scenario to avoid realizing a loss and to await price recovery or a valid stop-loss event. Technical indicators for the 5-minute timeframe are mixed; while MACD shows a bullish crossover, the price is trading below its 20 and 50-period Simple Moving Averages, and Stochastic K and Williams %R suggest the asset is approaching overbought levels, implying potential downward pressure.

Volatility (ATR and 20-day Volatility) is also zero. The AI trend analysis confirms a \"NEUTRAL\" trend with \"HIGH\" confidence due to this stagnation. While current volume is high (5,000,000), the lack of any price movement suggests this is not indicative of momentum or a developing trend. Crucially, no 1-hour data is available, preventing the primary instruction to weight medium-term trends more heavily and severely limiting the ability to confirm a directional bias.

Technically, the market exhibits extreme stagnation with a 0.00% daily change and low volatility (ATR 0.120). Despite this, momentum oscillators (Williams %R at -0.0 and Stochastic K at 100.0) are severely overbought on the 5-minute timeframe, suggesting a bearish bias or impending consolidation/reversal. Price is marginally below the 20 and 50 SMA ($120.36), which is a slight bearish indicator. MACD shows a weak bullish crossover but with very low values, indicating little directional conviction. A massive volume spike (33565x average) is observed, suggesting significant activity, yet without clear price direction, which is characteristic of accumulation/distribution in a tight range. No 1-hour data is available, preventing medium-term trend confirmation and reducing overall confidence.

Crucially, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data significantly hinders comprehensive trend confirmation, reducing overall confidence. Many momentum indicators (RSI 50.0, MACD 0.000) are neutral or missing (Williams %R, Stochastic), and there is no news sentiment to provide further confirmation. The calculated technical score is 3, which is below the aggressive mode's threshold of 4+ for a BUY action.

The lack of 1-hour data and inconsistencies in volatility metrics (ATR, 20-day Volatility, Volume MA all at 0) severely limit comprehensive analysis and reduce confidence.
