The current BTCUSD position is unprofitable (Net P&L $-0.76) and has not triggered the emergency stop-loss threshold of a 2%+ loss from the purchase price (current loss is only 0.093%). The AI trend analysis identifies complete price stagnation with 0.00% daily change and an ADX of 0.0, despite an extremely high volume ratio, suggesting a market without clear direction. Given the mandatory rule to only sell profitable positions or on a significant stop-loss, the only permissible action is to HOLD, awaiting either price recovery to profitability or a stop-loss trigger.",

The reasoning explicitly states a \"lack of clear directional conviction\" due to price consolidating within tight Bollinger Bands, near key moving averages, and momentum indicators showing conflicting signals (MACD bearish, while RSI/Stochastic are neutral). While current volume is exceptionally high (703206.42x average), this alone does not establish a clear trend given the AI's low confidence. Furthermore, the existing position for ETHUSD is currently unprofitable (Net P&L After Fees: $-0.21) and does not meet the 2%+ stop-loss threshold. As per the mandatory fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position must be held. Given the lack of clear conviction, conflicting technical signals, and the unprofitable status of the current holding, initiating a new BUY order or selling the existing position is not advisable. The recommendation is to HOLD the current position and await clearer, higher-confidence directional signals.",

According to the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, a sell is prohibited in this state. Additionally, the portfolio holds 5.4015 shares, which exceeds the maximum allowed shares per stock (5), preventing any further buy orders for LTCUSD. Technical analysis shows conflicting signals: strong oversold momentum indicators (Williams %R at -96.3, Stochastic K at 3.7) point to a potential bounce, confirmed by an extremely high volume ratio (34166.43x average) which could indicate accumulation. However, the price is currently below both SMA 20 and SMA 50, and the AI trend analysis is weakly bearish with low confidence. Without 1-hour data for medium-term trend confirmation, and with the inability to act due to existing position constraints and unprofitability, holding is the only permissible action.",

This dictates a HOLD action until the position becomes profitable or a stop-loss trigger is met (not applicable here). Technically, BCHUSD exhibits weak bullish momentum in the 5-minute timeframe, with its current price trading above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, supported by extremely high current volume. The daily change is positive (+0.37%). However, key momentum indicators like RSI (50.0) and MACD (flat) are neutral or lacking clear signals. Furthermore, crucial volatility and trend strength data (Williams %R, Stochastic K, ATR, 20-day Volatility) are absent, severely limiting a comprehensive assessment. The AI trend analysis notes \"weak bullish momentum\" and suggests the asset is \"overbought by Bollinger Bands,\" indicating potential short-term correction risks. Without 1-hour data, a medium-term trend cannot be confirmed. Given the mixed signals, low AI confidence, and the overriding constraint against selling at a loss, holding is the prudent action.",

The current BTCUSD position is unprofitable (Net P&L $-0.76) and has not triggered the emergency stop-loss threshold of a 2%+ loss from the purchase price (current loss is only 0.093%). The AI trend analysis identifies complete price stagnation with 0.00% daily change and an ADX of 0.0, despite an extremely high volume ratio, suggesting a market without clear direction.

The reasoning explicitly states a \"lack of clear directional conviction\" due to price consolidating within tight Bollinger Bands, near key moving averages, and momentum indicators showing conflicting signals (MACD bearish, while RSI/Stochastic are neutral). While current volume is exceptionally high (703206.42x average), this alone does not establish a clear trend given the AI's low confidence. Furthermore, the existing position for ETHUSD is currently unprofitable (Net P&L After Fees: $-0.21) and does not meet the 2%+ stop-loss threshold. As per the mandatory fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position must be held. Given the lack of clear conviction, conflicting technical signals, and the unprofitable status of the current holding, initiating a new BUY order or selling the existing position is not advisable. The recommendation is to HOLD the current position and await clearer, higher-confidence directional signals.",

According to the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, a sell is prohibited in this state. Additionally, the portfolio holds 5.4015 shares, which exceeds the maximum allowed shares per stock (5), preventing any further buy orders for LTCUSD. Technical analysis shows conflicting signals: strong oversold momentum indicators (Williams %R at -96.3, Stochastic K at 3.7) point to a potential bounce, confirmed by an extremely high volume ratio (34166.43x average) which could indicate accumulation. However, the price is currently below both SMA 20 and SMA 50, and the AI trend analysis is weakly bearish with low confidence. Without 1-hour data for medium-term trend confirmation, and with the inability to act due to existing position constraints and unprofitability, holding is the only permissible action.",

Technically, BCHUSD exhibits weak bullish momentum in the 5-minute timeframe, with its current price trading above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, supported by extremely high current volume. The daily change is positive (+0.37%). However, key momentum indicators like RSI (50.0) and MACD (flat) are neutral or lacking clear signals. Furthermore, crucial volatility and trend strength data (Williams %R, Stochastic K, ATR, 20-day Volatility) are absent, severely limiting a comprehensive assessment. The AI trend analysis notes \"weak bullish momentum\" and suggests the asset is \"overbought by Bollinger Bands,\" indicating potential short-term correction risks. Without 1-hour data, a medium-term trend cannot be confirmed. Given the mixed signals, low AI confidence, and the overriding constraint against selling at a loss, holding is the prudent action.",

As per mandatory trading rules, an unprofitable position must be held. Despite this, the technical analysis indicates a strong bullish setup: MACD has a bullish crossover with a positive histogram (0.003), and both Williams %R (-96.3) and Stochastic K (3.7) are in extremely oversold conditions, signaling strong potential for an upward bounce. Critically, there's a massive volume spike (Current Volume: 32,412,608 vs Volume MA: 950, a 34134.49x ratio) indicating significant buying interest and potential for a strong price movement. The AI trend analysis confirms a BULLISH trend with MEDIUM confidence based on momentum. However, a new BUY order is not possible for LTCUSD as the current position (5.4015 shares) already exceeds the \"Max shares per stock: 5\" constraint. Therefore, the only allowable action is to HOLD the existing position, anticipating a recovery into profitability based on the strong underlying bullish technicals.",

Despite the AI identifying a weak bullish trend, its confidence is LOW, and it flags the asset as overbought with several indicators undefined or zero, suggesting caution. The 5-minute technicals show a neutral RSI (50.0) and flat MACD (0.000). While price is slightly above SMAs, the overall momentum is not strong, and the volume and volatility data are highly ambiguous (high current volume but zero Volume MA and ATR). Given the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, we prioritize strong momentum and volume for BUY signals, which are not clearly present here, and an \"overbought\" condition further dampens BUY enthusiasm. No news is available for confirmation. Therefore, the most prudent action is to HOLD the unprofitable position and wait for clearer, stronger technical signals or profit recovery.",

Current 5-minute technicals for ETHUSD are overwhelmingly bullish: the price ($2482.93) is above both the SMA 20 ($2482.30) and SMA 50 ($2482.03), which are also in bullish alignment (SMA 20 > SMA 50). MACD shows a fresh bullish crossover (Line 0.075 > Signal 0.048) with a positive histogram (0.026), indicating strong upward momentum. RSI (54.5) is healthy, and both Williams %R (-20.1) and Stochastic K (79.9) signal robust bullish strength approaching overbought conditions. Critically, volume is exceptionally high (710237.21x average), providing strong confirmation for this positive price movement, which is a key priority in aggressive mode. The AI trend analysis independently confirms a HIGH confidence BULLISH outlook, reasoning that price is above key moving averages with strong positive momentum and high volume. Given these combined strong bullish indicators and the absence of any negative news, adding 0.001 shares to the position is justified to capitalize on the confirmed upward trend and leverage the current momentum.",

The current BTCUSD position is unprofitable (Net P&L $-0.76) and has not triggered the emergency stop-loss threshold of a 2%+ loss from the purchase price (current loss is only 0.093%). The AI trend analysis identifies complete price stagnation with 0.00% daily change and an ADX of 0.0, despite an extremely high volume ratio, suggesting a market without clear direction. Given the mandatory rule to only sell profitable positions or on a significant stop-loss, the only permissible action is to HOLD, awaiting either price recovery to profitability or a stop-loss trigger.",

The reasoning explicitly states a \"lack of clear directional conviction\" due to price consolidating within tight Bollinger Bands, near key moving averages, and momentum indicators showing conflicting signals (MACD bearish, while RSI/Stochastic are neutral). While current volume is exceptionally high (703206.42x average), this alone does not establish a clear trend given the AI's low confidence. Furthermore, the existing position for ETHUSD is currently unprofitable (Net P&L After Fees: $-0.21) and does not meet the 2%+ stop-loss threshold. As per the mandatory fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position must be held. Given the lack of clear conviction, conflicting technical signals, and the unprofitable status of the current holding, initiating a new BUY order or selling the existing position is not advisable. The recommendation is to HOLD the current position and await clearer, higher-confidence directional signals.",

According to the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, a sell is prohibited in this state. Additionally, the portfolio holds 5.4015 shares, which exceeds the maximum allowed shares per stock (5), preventing any further buy orders for LTCUSD. Technical analysis shows conflicting signals: strong oversold momentum indicators (Williams %R at -96.3, Stochastic K at 3.7) point to a potential bounce, confirmed by an extremely high volume ratio (34166.43x average) which could indicate accumulation. However, the price is currently below both SMA 20 and SMA 50, and the AI trend analysis is weakly bearish with low confidence. Without 1-hour data for medium-term trend confirmation, and with the inability to act due to existing position constraints and unprofitability, holding is the only permissible action.",

This dictates a HOLD action until the position becomes profitable or a stop-loss trigger is met (not applicable here). Technically, BCHUSD exhibits weak bullish momentum in the 5-minute timeframe, with its current price trading above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, supported by extremely high current volume. The daily change is positive (+0.37%). However, key momentum indicators like RSI (50.0) and MACD (flat) are neutral or lacking clear signals. Furthermore, crucial volatility and trend strength data (Williams %R, Stochastic K, ATR, 20-day Volatility) are absent, severely limiting a comprehensive assessment. The AI trend analysis notes \"weak bullish momentum\" and suggests the asset is \"overbought by Bollinger Bands,\" indicating potential short-term correction risks. Without 1-hour data, a medium-term trend cannot be confirmed. Given the mixed signals, low AI confidence, and the overriding constraint against selling at a loss, holding is the prudent action.",
