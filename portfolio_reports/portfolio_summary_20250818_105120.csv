While momentum oscillators like Stochastic and Williams %R are deeply oversold, suggesting a potential short-term bounce, this is not indicative of a broader trend reversal and does not align with the capital preservation focus of the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE'. Furthermore, the news sentiment for AAPL is NEGATIVE (-0.40), which explicitly advises against BUY actions according to our strategy's rules (Avoid BUY on negative news (sentiment < -0.2)). Crucially, with only $85.20 available cash, we are below the minimum cash reserve of $90 and do not have sufficient funds to purchase a share of AAPL ($230.88).
