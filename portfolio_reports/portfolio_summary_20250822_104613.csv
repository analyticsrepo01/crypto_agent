While Stochastic K (80.0) and Williams %R (-20.0) are approaching overbought levels, in crypto's trending markets and an aggressive mode, these are secondary to the overwhelming bullish price action and volume. Our current small short position (-0.000599... shares) is at an unrealized loss of -$0.05, which, for such a tiny position, represents a significant percentage loss.
