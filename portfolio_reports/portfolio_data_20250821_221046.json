      "reasoning": "The analysis for BTCUSD is restricted to the 5-minute timeframe due to the absence of 1-hour data, preventing proper dual timeframe alignment. While the current price shows zero daily change and stagnation, multiple key 5-minute technical indicators lean bearish: MACD Histogram is negative, the MACD Line is below the Signal Line, and the price is currently below both the SMA 20 and SMA 50. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates a BEARISH trend, albeit with LOW confidence, citing the bearish alignment of MACD and moving averages. The RSI and Stochastic K are neutral, failing to provide strong directional signals. Current volume is high, but without clear confirmation of buying pressure, it does not override the existing bearish technicals. Given the aggressive trading mode requiring technical scores 4+ for a BUY, and the prevalent short-term bearish signals (MACD, SMAs) indicating a bullish score well below this threshold, there is no actionable BUY signal. As there is no current position, a SELL action is not applicable. Therefore, the recommendation is to HOLD and wait for clearer bullish momentum or 1-hour data for trend confirmation.",

A bullish MACD crossover is evident with the MACD line (-0.006) above its signal line (-0.042) and a positive histogram (0.036). Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are nearing overbought levels, indicating strong recent buying pressure, which in crypto's trending markets often signals robust trend continuation. Critically, the current volume of 77,070,070 is an astronomical 711889.53x the average volume, providing exceptionally strong confirmation for the bullish price movement. The AI Trend Analysis also confirms a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. While the existing small position is currently unprofitable to sell per the fee-aware rules, the overwhelming technical strength and high confidence bullish trend, coupled with the aggressive trading mode to maximize profit, warrant an immediate BUY to capitalize on this momentum. There is no negative news to counteract this strong signal, and the trade size is well within limits.",

Despite a massive current volume (5,000,000) and an exceptionally high volume ratio relative to a zero average, this volume has not translated into any price movement or volatility (ATR 0, 20-day Volatility 0). The AI trend analysis explicitly confirms a \"NEUTRAL\" trend with \"HIGH\" confidence, citing \"no discernible trend or momentum.\" There is no 1-hour data for medium-term trend confirmation. In an aggressive trading mode, we prioritize momentum and volume, but here, the high volume without any price action or clear directional technical signals indicates consolidation, not an actionable entry point for profit maximization. No news sentiment is available to sway the decision. Given the lack of any discernible trend or momentum, entering a position would be pure speculation, violating the principle of acting on technical signals.",

Both Williams %R (-95.8) and Stochastic K (4.2) are deeply oversold, representing powerful reversal signals, especially potent in crypto markets where such extremes often lead to sharp rebounds. This is further corroborated by a weak bullish MACD crossover and a BULLISH AI Trend Analysis with Medium Confidence, which highlights the oversold bounce potential. Critically, the current volume is extraordinarily high (34484.88x average), signaling significant market interest and potential for a strong momentum-driven move upwards. While 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, the confluence of extreme short-term oversold conditions and massive volume provides high conviction for a decisive BUY. The existing unprofitable position will be held as per fee-aware sell rules, but new shares should be acquired to capitalize on the anticipated upward price movement.",

For new trades, despite the aggressive mode, a lack of comprehensive and reliable data prevents a confident decision. There is no 1-hour timeframe data available, directly contravening the instruction to weigh 1-hour trends more heavily for direction. While the 5-minute timeframe shows price above SMAs and high current volume, momentum oscillators like RSI (50.0) and MACD (0.000) are neutral. Crucial indicators such as Williams %R, Stochastic K, ATR, and 20-day Volatility are unavailable or show zero values, limiting the assessment of trend strength and sustainability. The AI trend analysis indicates BULLISH but with LOW Confidence and HIGH Risk due to missing data. Without strong, confirmed technical signals across multiple indicators and timeframes, initiating a new high-risk trade is not advisable, even in aggressive mode.",

Furthermore, the technical analysis for ZECUSD is highly ambiguous and compromised by widespread data inconsistencies (zero volatility, flat MACD, neutral RSI). While there's a slight positive daily change and extremely high current volume, the AI trend analysis indicates low confidence, a \"BULLISH\" trend but simultaneously \"overbought,\" and deems market conditions \"extremely ambiguous.\" With no 1-hour data available, short-term 5-minute indicators are mixed and lack strong conviction in either direction.

Technical analysis shows extreme stagnation: Current Price, Daily Change, RSI, MACD, SMAs, ATR, and Volatility are all at neutral or zero values. The AI Trend Analysis confirms a NEUTRAL trend with HIGH confidence due to complete price stagnation and lack of movement across all indicators, indicating extreme consolidation. While volume is high at 5,000,000, it has not translated into any price movement or volatility, rendering it ineffective as a directional signal in this context.

The AI Trend Analysis confirms a \"NEUTRAL\" trend with \"HIGH\" confidence due to \"extreme price stagnation and a complete lack of volatility.\" With no 1-hour data available, medium-term trend confirmation is impossible.

The RSI and Stochastic K are neutral, failing to provide strong directional signals. Current volume is high, but without clear confirmation of buying pressure, it does not override the existing bearish technicals. Given the aggressive trading mode requiring technical scores 4+ for a BUY, and the prevalent short-term bearish signals (MACD, SMAs) indicating a bullish score well below this threshold, there is no actionable BUY signal. As there is no current position, a SELL action is not applicable. Therefore, the recommendation is to HOLD and wait for clearer bullish momentum or 1-hour data for trend confirmation.",

Critically, the current volume of 77,070,070 is an astronomical 711889.53x the average volume, providing exceptionally strong confirmation for the bullish price movement. The AI Trend Analysis also confirms a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. While the existing small position is currently unprofitable to sell per the fee-aware rules, the overwhelming technical strength and high confidence bullish trend, coupled with the aggressive trading mode to maximize profit, warrant an immediate BUY to capitalize on this momentum.

Critically, the current volume is extraordinarily high (34484.88x average), signaling significant market interest and potential for a strong momentum-driven move upwards. While 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, the confluence of extreme short-term oversold conditions and massive volume provides high conviction for a decisive BUY. The existing unprofitable position will be held as per fee-aware sell rules, but new shares should be acquired to capitalize on the anticipated upward price movement.",

For new trades, despite the aggressive mode, a lack of comprehensive and reliable data prevents a confident decision. There is no 1-hour timeframe data available, directly contravening the instruction to weigh 1-hour trends more heavily for direction. While the 5-minute timeframe shows price above SMAs and high current volume, momentum oscillators like RSI (50.0) and MACD (0.000) are neutral. Crucial indicators such as Williams %R, Stochastic K, ATR, and 20-day Volatility are unavailable or show zero values, limiting the assessment of trend strength and sustainability. The AI trend analysis indicates BULLISH but with LOW Confidence and HIGH Risk due to missing data. Without strong, confirmed technical signals across multiple indicators and timeframes, initiating a new high-risk trade is not advisable, even in aggressive mode.",

Furthermore, the technical analysis for ZECUSD is highly ambiguous and compromised by widespread data inconsistencies (zero volatility, flat MACD, neutral RSI). While there's a slight positive daily change and extremely high current volume, the AI trend analysis indicates low confidence, a \"BULLISH\" trend but simultaneously \"overbought,\" and deems market conditions \"extremely ambiguous.\" With no 1-hour data available, short-term 5-minute indicators are mixed and lack strong conviction in either direction.

Technical analysis shows extreme stagnation: Current Price, Daily Change, RSI, MACD, SMAs, ATR, and Volatility are all at neutral or zero values. The AI Trend Analysis confirms a NEUTRAL trend with HIGH confidence due to complete price stagnation and lack of movement across all indicators, indicating extreme consolidation. While volume is high at 5,000,000, it has not translated into any price movement or volatility, rendering it ineffective as a directional signal in this context.

The AI Trend Analysis confirms a \"NEUTRAL\" trend with \"HIGH\" confidence due to \"extreme price stagnation and a complete lack of volatility.\" With no 1-hour data available, medium-term trend confirmation is impossible. Given the aggressive trading mode, entering a position in a completely flat market with guaranteed fee erosion and no potential for profit is counterproductive.

The AI Trend Analysis corroborates a BEARISH trend, albeit with LOW confidence, citing the bearish alignment of MACD and moving averages. The RSI and Stochastic K are neutral, failing to provide strong directional signals. Current volume is high, but without clear confirmation of buying pressure, it does not override the existing bearish technicals. Given the aggressive trading mode requiring technical scores 4+ for a BUY, and the prevalent short-term bearish signals (MACD, SMAs) indicating a bullish score well below this threshold, there is no actionable BUY signal. As there is no current position, a SELL action is not applicable. Therefore, the recommendation is to HOLD and wait for clearer bullish momentum or 1-hour data for trend confirmation.",

Critically, the current volume of 77,070,070 is an astronomical 711889.53x the average volume, providing exceptionally strong confirmation for the bullish price movement. The AI Trend Analysis also confirms a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. While the existing small position is currently unprofitable to sell per the fee-aware rules, the overwhelming technical strength and high confidence bullish trend, coupled with the aggressive trading mode to maximize profit, warrant an immediate BUY to capitalize on this momentum.

Critically, the current volume is extraordinarily high (34484.88x average), signaling significant market interest and potential for a strong momentum-driven move upwards. While 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, the confluence of extreme short-term oversold conditions and massive volume provides high conviction for a decisive BUY.

For new trades, despite the aggressive mode, a lack of comprehensive and reliable data prevents a confident decision. There is no 1-hour timeframe data available, directly contravening the instruction to weigh 1-hour trends more heavily for direction. While the 5-minute timeframe shows price above SMAs and high current volume, momentum oscillators like RSI (50.0) and MACD (0.000) are neutral. Crucial indicators such as Williams %R, Stochastic K, ATR, and 20-day Volatility are unavailable or show zero values, limiting the assessment of trend strength and sustainability.

Furthermore, the technical analysis for ZECUSD is highly ambiguous and compromised by widespread data inconsistencies (zero volatility, flat MACD, neutral RSI). While there's a slight positive daily change and extremely high current volume, the AI trend analysis indicates low confidence, a \"BULLISH\" trend but simultaneously \"overbought,\" and deems market conditions \"extremely ambiguous.\" With no 1-hour data available, short-term 5-minute indicators are mixed and lack strong conviction in either direction.
