While momentum oscillators like RSI (36.9), Williams %R (-68.0), and Stochastic (D: 25.5) are in the lower range, approaching oversold conditions, they do not yet confirm strong reversal or buy signals required for a balanced trading approach. The AI Trend analysis confirms a NEUTRAL trend with MEDIUM confidence, indicating limited downside or potential for a bounce, but not a clear direction. Volume data is unavailable, preventing crucial confirmation of any price moves. Critically, with an available cash of $111.32 and a minimum cash reserve of $90, only $21.32 is available for trading, which is insufficient to purchase 1 share of AAPL at $231.03. Therefore, no BUY trade can be executed due to funding constraints. We also hold 0 shares, so a SELL is not possible.

AMZN is significantly overbought according to RSI (71.5), Williams %R (-14.1), and both Stochastic K (85.9) and D (90.7), suggesting a high probability of an imminent pullback. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, indicating a ""BEARISH"" trend with ""MEDIUM"" confidence and ""HIGH"" risk due to overbought conditions.
