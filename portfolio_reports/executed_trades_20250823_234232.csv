Momentum indicators like Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are very high, signaling strong upward pressure, which per crypto-adjusted rules, indicates powerful momentum. Crucially, the current volume is exceptionally high (77,789,945) at 712438.72x the average, providing strong confirmation for the bullish trend. The AI trend analysis also confirms a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. Although 1-hour data is unavailable, the 5-minute data provides an actionable, high-conviction BUY signal in line with the aggressive trading mode. The existing position is currently unprofitable to sell and therefore will be held as per fee-aware rules, while new shares are acquired to capitalize on the strong bullish trend.",N/A,2482.92,50.0,sim_1756006940,Submitted,0.020138,0,0,0.000105,2025-08-23,0.0,900.0,20

Price is trading above both SMA 20 ($120.35) and SMA 50 ($120.36), and the MACD shows a clear bullish crossover with a positive and increasing histogram, indicating robust upward momentum. Crucially, current volume is an astonishing 34177.67x its average, providing overwhelming confirmation for the strength of this bullish move. While Williams %R and Stochastic K are extremely overbought indicating short-term overextension, RSI remains in a neutral-bullish zone (53.8). In this aggressive trading mode, prioritizing momentum and exceptional volume, these short-term overbought signals are outweighed by the strong underlying bullish trend. With no 1-hour data, the 5-minute analysis dictates immediate action. I am acting decisively to maximize profit by adding to a profitable position in a confirmed bullish market.",N/A,120.42,50.0,sim_1756006940,Submitted,0.415213,0,0,0.00014,2025-08-23,0.0,900.0,20
