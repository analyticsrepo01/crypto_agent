Critically, there is NO 1-HOUR TIMEFRAME DATA available. As per instructions, the balanced trading mode requires weighing 1-hour trends more heavily and demands dual-timeframe alignment for high confidence. Without this essential medium-term data, a high-confidence trade is not possible. The AI trend analysis confirms a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence and HIGH risk. Furthermore, the volume ratio is extremely high, indicating a period of high volatility, which the balanced trading mode advises against. While oversold conditions might tempt a BUY, the absence of higher timeframe confirmation, the bearish trend, and the high-risk environment make initiating a new position too speculative and inconsistent with capital preservation priorities.

The AI trend analysis confirms a \"BEARISH\" trend with \"MEDIUM\" confidence. Although momentum indicators like Williams %R (-81.8) and Stochastic K (18.2) are in oversold territory, suggesting a potential short-term bounce, this is a counter-trend signal and does not provide sufficient confirmation to initiate a BUY in a balanced trading mode, which prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators. There is no 1-hour data available for medium-term trend confirmation, preventing dual timeframe alignment. With no news data to influence risk assessment, and the dominant bearish technicals, awaiting clearer bullish confirmation or a less volatile and more aligned trading environment is the prudent approach.",

      "reasoning": "The 5-minute timeframe for AMZN shows a bullish trend with the current price ($231.06) trading above the SMA 20 ($230.84) and SMA 50 ($230.59), and the MACD displaying positive momentum (MACD Line 0.159 above Signal 0.150, positive Histogram 0.009). Current volume is exceptionally high, supporting the price action. However, critical momentum indicators such as RSI (79.3), Williams %R (-26.1), and Stochastic K (73.9) are all signaling significantly overbought conditions. This indicates a high likelihood of a short-term pullback or consolidation, which poses a risk for entering a new long position. Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of the medium-term trend. The 'Balanced Trading Mode' explicitly requires weighting 1-hour trends more heavily and achieving high confidence only when both timeframes agree. Without this medium-term confirmation and with multiple overbought short-term indicators, the technical alignment for a high-priority BUY is not met (requires technical score 6+ and multiple confirming indicators without conflict). The current conditions do not present a clear SELL signal either, as the underlying trend is still bullish. As per the strategy, capital preservation is prioritized, and trades are avoided during periods of potential high volatility or when strong technical alignment is lacking due to conflicting indicators and missing data. No news sentiment is available to influence the decision. Therefore, holding (no new position) is the most prudent action.",

However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in overbought territory (72.9), suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Critically, there is *no 1-hour timeframe data available*, which directly conflicts with the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' requirement to weigh 1-hour trends more heavily and demand dual-timeframe alignment for high confidence trades. The trading mode prioritizes capital preservation and requires multiple confirming indicators and strong technical alignment, which cannot be achieved without the medium-term 1-hour data. The AI also notes the absence of dual-timeframe confirmation and other critical indicators, limiting the reliability of the trend strength. Given the overbought RSI and, more importantly, the complete lack of medium-term trend confirmation, initiating a BUY at this time does not align with the strict capital preservation and robust technical validation standards of the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE'.

MACD indicators (MACD line below signal and negative histogram) confirm this strong negative momentum. The AI trend analysis also indicates a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence and a HIGH risk level. While momentum indicators like RSI (11.9), Williams %R (-75.5), and Stochastic K (24.5) show extreme oversold conditions, these are not sufficient to initiate a BUY trade in a balanced strategy, as they occur within an established downtrend and do not signify a confirmed reversal. Crucially, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents dual timeframe analysis and alignment, which is a mandatory requirement for high-confidence trades in BALANCED TRADING MODE. This lack of confirmation, combined with the dominant bearish trend and high risk assessment, contradicts the strategy's focus on capital preservation and demand for strong technical alignment from multiple confirming indicators. A BUY action would be premature and against the core principles of avoiding trades during high volatility periods and demanding strong technical alignment.",

This creates significant conflicting signals, leading to poor technical alignment. Furthermore, critical 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, preventing a robust dual-timeframe analysis and medium-term trend confirmation, which is essential for high-confidence trades.

While MACD and SMA positioning show some short-term bullish momentum, the overwhelming overbought signals from multiple oscillators strongly suggest an impending reversal or consolidation, making a BUY highly risky. Under the BALANCED TRADING MODE, which prioritizes capital preservation and demands strong technical alignment, buying into such an overextended and high-risk situation is not advisable.

Current volume is exceptionally high, supporting the price action. However, critical momentum indicators such as RSI (79.3), Williams %R (-26.1), and Stochastic K (73.9) are all signaling significantly overbought conditions. This indicates a high likelihood of a short-term pullback or consolidation, which poses a risk for entering a new long position. Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of the medium-term trend. The 'Balanced Trading Mode' explicitly requires weighting 1-hour trends more heavily and achieving high confidence only when both timeframes agree. Without this medium-term confirmation and with multiple overbought short-term indicators, the technical alignment for a high-priority BUY is not met (requires technical score 6+ and multiple confirming indicators without conflict). The current conditions do not present a clear SELL signal either, as the underlying trend is still bullish. As per the strategy, capital preservation is prioritized, and trades are avoided during periods of potential high volatility or when strong technical alignment is lacking due to conflicting indicators and missing data.

The AI Trend Analysis confirms a HIGH confidence BULLISH trend, supported by high current volume. However, multiple crucial momentum indicators signal that the stock is currently overbought: RSI (14) at 67.2 (approaching overbought), Williams %R at -16.0 (overbought), and Stochastic K at 84.0 (overbought). The BALANCED TRADING MODE prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple *confirming* indicators for trades, avoiding high volatility. Entering a position when momentum indicators suggest overbought conditions carries a significant risk of short-term consolidation or pullback, which goes against the strategy's emphasis on capital preservation and strong technical alignment. Additionally, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents robust dual-timeframe confirmation, which limits overall confidence for a high-priority trade. While the trend is strong, the immediate entry risk due to overbought momentum is too high for the active balanced strategy, despite the technical score.",

Critically, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of a broader trend and violates the \"Dual Timeframe Alignment\" requirement for high confidence trades in Balanced Trading Mode. The AI trend analysis also indicates a NEUTRAL trend with LOW confidence and MEDIUM risk. Given the balanced trading mode's emphasis on capital preservation, demanding multiple confirming indicators across timeframes, and requiring strong technical alignment for high-priority trades, the current mixed signals and the absence of a crucial higher timeframe confirmation make entering a position too risky at this time.

While short-term oscillators like Williams %R (-81.8) and Stochastic K (18.2) suggest oversold conditions, the prevailing downtrend and strong bearish momentum (as confirmed by the AI) override these short-term signals for a BUY decision. No 1-hour data is available, preventing dual-timeframe alignment for a high-confidence trade. As per the BALANCED TRADING MODE, capital preservation is prioritized, and initiating a BUY into a confirmed bearish trend with no positive news sentiment is not advisable and requires a technical score of 6+, which is not met (score is very low for a BUY).

The AI trend analysis itself notes this, suggesting a potential short-term pullback or consolidation despite the bullish trend. Given the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE', capital preservation is prioritized, and trades during high volatility periods (which can follow overbought conditions) are to be avoided. The critical absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents confirmation of a stronger, medium-term trend and significantly lowers the overall confidence for a directional trade, as robust decisions require dual timeframe alignment. While the underlying trend is bullish, the overbought conditions signal a high-risk entry point for a new BUY position. There is no news data to influence the decision.

The absence of this critical medium-term confirmation prevents the strong technical alignment necessary for a high-priority BUY.

The AI trend analysis confirms a 'BEARISH' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence and 'HIGH' risk, further advising caution. A BUY decision would require a technical score of 6+ and strong confirmation, which is not present due to the prevailing bearish trend and the lack of longer-term data. Additionally, the high Volume Ratio could indicate elevated volatility, which the strategy seeks to avoid for new trades.

A critical factor is the complete absence of 1-hour timeframe data, which prevents the essential dual timeframe analysis and trend confirmation mandated by the Balanced Trading Mode, significantly lowering the overall technical alignment confidence for a directional trade. Most importantly, the extremely high Volume Ratio (1,928,880.00x average) signifies a period of very high volatility, a condition explicitly to be avoided for trades under the current strategy to prioritize capital preservation.

Without this essential medium-term data, a high-confidence trade is not possible. The AI trend analysis confirms a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence and HIGH risk. Furthermore, the volume ratio is extremely high, indicating a period of high volatility, which the balanced trading mode advises against. While oversold conditions might tempt a BUY, the absence of higher timeframe confirmation, the bearish trend, and the high-risk environment make initiating a new position too speculative and inconsistent with capital preservation priorities.

The AI trend analysis confirms a \"BEARISH\" trend with \"MEDIUM\" confidence. Although momentum indicators like Williams %R (-81.8) and Stochastic K (18.2) are in oversold territory, suggesting a potential short-term bounce, this is a counter-trend signal and does not provide sufficient confirmation to initiate a BUY in a balanced trading mode, which prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators.

Current volume is exceptionally high, supporting the price action. However, critical momentum indicators such as RSI (79.3), Williams %R (-26.1), and Stochastic K (73.9) are all signaling significantly overbought conditions. This indicates a high likelihood of a short-term pullback or consolidation, which poses a risk for entering a new long position. Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of the medium-term trend. The 'Balanced Trading Mode' explicitly requires weighting 1-hour trends more heavily and achieving high confidence only when both timeframes agree. Without this medium-term confirmation and with multiple overbought short-term indicators, the technical alignment for a high-priority BUY is not met (requires technical score 6+ and multiple confirming indicators without conflict). The current conditions do not present a clear SELL signal either, as the underlying trend is still bullish. As per the strategy, capital preservation is prioritized, and trades are avoided during periods of potential high volatility or when strong technical alignment is lacking due to conflicting indicators and missing data. No news sentiment is available to influence the decision. Therefore, holding (no new position) is the most prudent action.",

The AI also notes the absence of dual-timeframe confirmation and other critical indicators, limiting the reliability of the trend strength.
