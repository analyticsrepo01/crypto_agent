Short-term (5-minute) technical indicators demonstrate strong bullish momentum: MACD line (6.681) is significantly above its signal line (2.047) with a positive histogram (4.634), and the current price ($107807.83) is comfortably above both the SMA 20 ($107753.93) and SMA 50 ($107758.24). Furthermore, the current volume is exceptionally high (78,410,939), with a massive Volume Ratio (31220780.72x average), strongly confirming active buying interest and supporting the upward momentum. While fast oscillators like Stochastic K (80.0) and Williams %R (-20.0) are nearing overbought levels, the crucial RSI (14) remains neutral at 50.0, which, for crypto, suggests there is still potential for further price appreciation before truly overbought conditions are met (RSI > 80).

Although the absence of 1-hour data prevents medium-term trend confirmation and the AI notes ""stagnation"" in trend strength (likely referring to ADX/SD), the primary momentum and price action indicators on the 5-minute timeframe remain strong.
