Furthermore, the extremely high Current Volume and Volume Ratio suggest significant market interest and confirm that any directional move, especially a rebound, will likely be strong. Although a bearish MACD crossover introduces some uncertainty, it is considered a lagging indicator; in an aggressive strategy, prioritizing leading indicators like extreme oversold oscillators and high momentum for a potential reversal is paramount.
