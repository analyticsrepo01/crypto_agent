Critically, the current holding of 5.4015 shares exceeds the 'Max shares per stock: 5' constraint, necessitating an immediate reduction of the position. The market exhibits extreme flatness with a 0% daily change, a neutral AI trend, and all moving averages clustered tightly together, indicating no clear directional momentum despite a massive volume ratio spike. The MACD shows a very slight bearish cross, while other short-term indicators like RSI are neutral. Given the aggressive trading mode, the lack of a compelling bullish signal, the current profitability, and the portfolio constraint violation, selling the entire position is the most decisive and prudent action to lock in profits, rebalance the portfolio, and free up capital for future high-momentum opportunities.",N/A,120.42,49.99994946,sim_1756024361,Submitted,0.415213,0,0,0.000107,2025-08-24,0.0,999.9999494599999,58,

This indicates extreme bullish momentum and strong buying pressure, which is prioritized for profit maximization. The current price of $577.66 trading above both SMA 20 ($575.53) and SMA 50 ($575.53) further confirms a short-term uptrend. While MACD and RSI are neutral, and the AI's reasoning noted ""weak bullish momentum"" and a potential ""overbought condition"" (unsupported by raw RSI data), these are overridden by the dominant volume signal and positive price action. The AI's overall trend analysis remains BULLISH with medium confidence. The existing unprofitable position will be held as per mandatory rules, but a new BUY order is warranted based on the strong technical signals and aggressive strategy to capture momentum.",N/A,577.66,,sim_1756024362,Submitted,0.086556,0,0,0.000162,2025-08-24,0.0,999.9999494599999,58,50.0
