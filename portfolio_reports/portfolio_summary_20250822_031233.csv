The AI trend analysis explicitly confirms a BEARISH trend with medium confidence, citing ""Price is trading below key moving averages, confirmed by strong bearish volume activity"". Given the aggressive trading mode, a BUY action requires a technical score of 4+, and our current analysis, despite the bullish MACD, yields a score well below this threshold due to prevailing bearish indicators and overbought oscillators.
