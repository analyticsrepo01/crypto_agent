The MACD shows a strong bullish crossover with the MACD Line (0.119) well above its Signal Line (0.055) and a positive MACD Histogram (0.064), indicating increasing buying pressure. Momentum indicators further support this bullish sentiment: RSI (14) is at 64.3, strong but not yet overbought (above 80 for crypto), Stochastic K is at 79.9 (approaching overbought), and Williams %R is at -20.1, reflecting strong buying pressure near overbought levels. Crucially, current volume is an exceptional 77,556,954, which is 714804.12 times the average volume, confirming a significant influx of capital supporting the upward move. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, identifying a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence.
