For potential new trades, the comprehensive analysis reveals a STRONG_BEARISH trend with HIGH confidence. This is supported by the current price ($2480.44) being below both the SMA 20 ($2482.67) and SMA 50 ($2482.23), a clear bearish MACD crossover (MACD Line -0.158 below Signal 0.033, Histogram -0.191), and a negative daily change. This bearish momentum is strongly confirmed by exceptionally high volume (Volume Ratio: 706211.09x average).
