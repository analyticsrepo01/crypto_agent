    "AAPL": {
      "action": "HOLD",
      "priority": "LOW",
      "reasoning": "The overall trend for AAPL is strongly bearish, confirmed by price trading below all key moving averages (SMA 20, 50; EMA 12, 26), negative MACD momentum, and the AI trend analysis (BEARISH, HIGH Confidence). This strongly supports a SELL bias. However, several critical short-term momentum indicators such as Williams %R (-89.0), Stochastic K (11.0), and Stochastic D (11.8) are deep in oversold territory. The price is also at the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting a potential short-term bounce or consolidation. In \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\", capital preservation and requiring multiple *confirming* indicators are paramount. The conflict between the strong bearish trend and the immediate oversold conditions introduces short-term uncertainty and higher risk for initiating a new SELL trade, as it could mean selling at a temporary bottom. Therefore, despite the bearish bias, it is prudent to HOLD (take no action) and await better technical alignment or a short-term rebound before considering a SELL position. No news data is available to influence the decision.",

    "META": {
      "action": "HOLD",
      "priority": "MEDIUM",
      "reasoning": "The comprehensive technical analysis for META presents a predominantly bearish outlook. The current price ($765.34) is trading below both the SMA 20 ($765.48) and SMA 50 ($768.74), indicating a downtrend. Further confirming this weakness, the EMA 12 ($765.53) is below the EMA 26 ($766.31), signaling a bearish crossover. The Stochastic K (48.5) is also below Stochastic D (58.8), which is a bearish momentum signal. The AI Trend Analysis explicitly categorizes the trend as 'BEARISH' with 'MEDIUM' confidence, citing price trading below bearishly crossed moving averages. While MACD shows a bullish crossover (Line -0.775 > Signal -1.121) and a positive histogram (0.345), these are outweighed by the multiple confirming bearish indicators. The overall technical score is 2, which falls well below the 6+ requirement for a high-priority BUY and strongly aligns with the 4- threshold for a high-priority SELL. Since the current position for META is 0 shares, and in 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' prioritizing capital preservation, initiating a short position is not advisable without explicit instruction, nor is a long position given the strong bearish technicals. Therefore, the prudent action is to avoid opening any position. No news sentiment is available to influence this decision.",

      "reasoning": "AMZN is exhibiting extremely oversold conditions across multiple reliable momentum indicators. Its RSI (14) is at 27.6, Williams %R is at -89.4, and both Stochastic K (10.6) and D (19.2) are well below the 20-level, all signaling a strong oversold state. Furthermore, the price is trading below its lower Bollinger Band, a classic setup for an imminent upward correction or bounce. While lagging indicators like MACD and moving averages reflect the recent bearish price action, the confluence of these leading oversold indicators, confirmed by the AI's \"BULLISH\" trend analysis (due to oversold conditions), strongly suggests a high probability of a short-term relief rally. This aligns with the balanced trading mode's focus on strong technical alignment for counter-trend reversals. There is no news sentiment available to introduce additional risk.",

    "NFLX": {
      "action": "HOLD",
      "priority": "LOW",
      "reasoning": "The primary reason for HOLD is the insufficient available cash ($963.60) to purchase 1 share of NFLX at the current price ($1238.25), making a BUY action impossible. Furthermore, while the general trend for NFLX appears bearish (price below all key moving averages, bearish MACD, and AI trend analysis confirming BEARISH), the momentum indicators (Williams %R at -92.3 and Stochastic K at 7.7, D at 6.9) are deeply oversold. This suggests a potential for a near-term bounce, which contradicts a high-conviction SELL signal, especially in a balanced trading mode that prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators for strong trades. The conflicting signals between the bearish trend and oversold conditions do not present strong technical alignment for either a high-priority BUY or SELL.",

However, key momentum indicators (Williams %R at -92.1, Stochastic K at 7.9, and price near the lower Bollinger Band) are deeply oversold. While the dominant trend is bearish, these oversold conditions suggest a high probability of a short-term bounce or reversal. In \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\", prioritizing capital preservation and demanding multiple confirming indicators, the conflicting signals (strong bearish trend vs. oversold short-term momentum) lead to a lack of strong technical alignment for an immediate trade. Initiating a short position (SELL) into oversold conditions carries the risk of a swift counter-trend bounce, making it a poor entry point. A BUY is strongly counter-trend. Therefore, waiting for clearer technical alignment or a better entry point that aligns with the dominant trend is the most prudent action.",

The AI trend analysis confirms this bearish bias with medium confidence and a high-risk level. However, the stock is currently in a deeply oversold condition, indicated by a low RSI (34.6), extremely low Williams %R (-86.3), and oversold Stochastic K and D values (13.7 and 14.9). The price is also at the lower Bollinger Band. In 'BALANCED TRADING MODE', we prioritize capital preservation and demand multiple confirming indicators. While the trend is bearish, the oversold state acts as a significant disconfirming indicator for an immediate SELL, suggesting a potential short-term bounce or consolidation. A high-priority BUY is ruled out due to the dominant bearish trend. Given the conflicting signals between the underlying bearish trend and the immediate oversold condition, combined with the \"HIGH Risk Level\" and the requirement for \"strong technical alignment,\" a HOLD decision is prudent to avoid entering a trade on mixed signals and to preserve capital. No news data is available, so the decision relies solely on technical analysis and mode constraints.",

A critical issue is the unavailability of reliable volume data (reported as -1), which significantly impairs the ability to confirm the strength and conviction behind any price movement. Furthermore, momentum indicators like Stochastic K (22.0) and Williams %R (-78.0) are approaching oversold levels. This suggests that the current bearish pressure might be nearing exhaustion, which increases the risk of a short-term bounce against a new short position. Given the missing critical data, the conflicting momentum signals with the overall bearish trend, and the AI's 'MEDIUM' confidence in the bearish trend, high uncertainty makes a trade undesirable under a balanced, risk-averse strategy, thus warranting a HOLD position.",

This strongly supports a SELL bias. However, several critical short-term momentum indicators such as Williams %R (-89.0), Stochastic K (11.0), and Stochastic D (11.8) are deep in oversold territory. The price is also at the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting a potential short-term bounce or consolidation. In \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\", capital preservation and requiring multiple *confirming* indicators are paramount. The conflict between the strong bearish trend and the immediate oversold conditions introduces short-term uncertainty and higher risk for initiating a new SELL trade, as it could mean selling at a temporary bottom. Therefore, despite the bearish bias, it is prudent to HOLD (take no action) and await better technical alignment or a short-term rebound before considering a SELL position.

The current price ($765.34) is trading below both the SMA 20 ($765.48) and SMA 50 ($768.74), indicating a downtrend. Further confirming this weakness, the EMA 12 ($765.53) is below the EMA 26 ($766.31), signaling a bearish crossover. The Stochastic K (48.5) is also below Stochastic D (58.8), which is a bearish momentum signal. The AI Trend Analysis explicitly categorizes the trend as 'BEARISH' with 'MEDIUM' confidence, citing price trading below bearishly crossed moving averages. While MACD shows a bullish crossover (Line -0.775 > Signal -1.121) and a positive histogram (0.345), these are outweighed by the multiple confirming bearish indicators. The overall technical score is 2, which falls well below the 6+ requirement for a high-priority BUY and strongly aligns with the 4- threshold for a high-priority SELL. Since the current position for META is 0 shares, and in 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' prioritizing capital preservation, initiating a short position is not advisable without explicit instruction, nor is a long position given the strong bearish technicals.

Furthermore, the price is trading below its lower Bollinger Band, a classic setup for an imminent upward correction or bounce. While lagging indicators like MACD and moving averages reflect the recent bearish price action, the confluence of these leading oversold indicators, confirmed by the AI's \"BULLISH\" trend analysis (due to oversold conditions), strongly suggests a high probability of a short-term relief rally.

Furthermore, while the general trend for NFLX appears bearish (price below all key moving averages, bearish MACD, and AI trend analysis confirming BEARISH), the momentum indicators (Williams %R at -92.3 and Stochastic K at 7.7, D at 6.9) are deeply oversold. This suggests a potential for a near-term bounce, which contradicts a high-conviction SELL signal, especially in a balanced trading mode that prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators for strong trades. The conflicting signals between the bearish trend and oversold conditions do not present strong technical alignment for either a high-priority BUY or SELL.",

However, key momentum indicators (Williams %R at -92.1, Stochastic K at 7.9, and price near the lower Bollinger Band) are deeply oversold. While the dominant trend is bearish, these oversold conditions suggest a high probability of a short-term bounce or reversal. In \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\", prioritizing capital preservation and demanding multiple confirming indicators, the conflicting signals (strong bearish trend vs. oversold short-term momentum) lead to a lack of strong technical alignment for an immediate trade. Initiating a short position (SELL) into oversold conditions carries the risk of a swift counter-trend bounce, making it a poor entry point. A BUY is strongly counter-trend. Therefore, waiting for clearer technical alignment or a better entry point that aligns with the dominant trend is the most prudent action.",

However, the stock is currently in a deeply oversold condition, indicated by a low RSI (34.6), extremely low Williams %R (-86.3), and oversold Stochastic K and D values (13.7 and 14.9). The price is also at the lower Bollinger Band. In 'BALANCED TRADING MODE', we prioritize capital preservation and demand multiple confirming indicators. While the trend is bearish, the oversold state acts as a significant disconfirming indicator for an immediate SELL, suggesting a potential short-term bounce or consolidation. A high-priority BUY is ruled out due to the dominant bearish trend. Given the conflicting signals between the underlying bearish trend and the immediate oversold condition, combined with the \"HIGH Risk Level\" and the requirement for \"strong technical alignment,\" a HOLD decision is prudent to avoid entering a trade on mixed signals and to preserve capital.

A critical issue is the unavailability of reliable volume data (reported as -1), which significantly impairs the ability to confirm the strength and conviction behind any price movement. Furthermore, momentum indicators like Stochastic K (22.0) and Williams %R (-78.0) are approaching oversold levels. This suggests that the current bearish pressure might be nearing exhaustion, which increases the risk of a short-term bounce against a new short position. Given the missing critical data, the conflicting momentum signals with the overall bearish trend, and the AI's 'MEDIUM' confidence in the bearish trend, high uncertainty makes a trade undesirable under a balanced, risk-averse strategy, thus warranting a HOLD position.",

The AI trend analysis, though bullish, highlights this contradiction and notes a prevailing weak bearish trend based on ADX. This lack of strong, consistent technical alignment across multiple indicators, especially for price action relative to short-term EMAs, does not meet the \"demand multiple confirming indicators\" and \"focus on strong technical alignment\" requirements for a high-priority BUY in a balanced trading mode.

The combined signals, particularly the overbought momentum and the lack of reliable volume data, do not provide the \"strong technical alignment\" or a technical score of 6+ required for a high-priority BUY, prioritizing capital preservation.",

This strongly supports a SELL bias. However, several critical short-term momentum indicators such as Williams %R (-89.0), Stochastic K (11.0), and Stochastic D (11.8) are deep in oversold territory. The price is also at the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting a potential short-term bounce or consolidation. In \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\", capital preservation and requiring multiple *confirming* indicators are paramount. The conflict between the strong bearish trend and the immediate oversold conditions introduces short-term uncertainty and higher risk for initiating a new SELL trade, as it could mean selling at a temporary bottom. Therefore, despite the bearish bias, it is prudent to HOLD (take no action) and await better technical alignment or a short-term rebound before considering a SELL position.

The current price ($765.34) is trading below both the SMA 20 ($765.48) and SMA 50 ($768.74), indicating a downtrend. Further confirming this weakness, the EMA 12 ($765.53) is below the EMA 26 ($766.31), signaling a bearish crossover. The Stochastic K (48.5) is also below Stochastic D (58.8), which is a bearish momentum signal. The AI Trend Analysis explicitly categorizes the trend as 'BEARISH' with 'MEDIUM' confidence, citing price trading below bearishly crossed moving averages. While MACD shows a bullish crossover (Line -0.775 > Signal -1.121) and a positive histogram (0.345), these are outweighed by the multiple confirming bearish indicators. The overall technical score is 2, which falls well below the 6+ requirement for a high-priority BUY and strongly aligns with the 4- threshold for a high-priority SELL. Since the current position for META is 0 shares, and in 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' prioritizing capital preservation, initiating a short position is not advisable without explicit instruction, nor is a long position given the strong bearish technicals. Therefore, the prudent action is to avoid opening any position. No news sentiment is available to influence this decision.",

Furthermore, the price is trading below its lower Bollinger Band, a classic setup for an imminent upward correction or bounce. While lagging indicators like MACD and moving averages reflect the recent bearish price action, the confluence of these leading oversold indicators, confirmed by the AI's \"BULLISH\" trend analysis (due to oversold conditions), strongly suggests a high probability of a short-term relief rally.

This suggests a potential for a near-term bounce, which contradicts a high-conviction SELL signal, especially in a balanced trading mode that prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators for strong trades. The conflicting signals between the bearish trend and oversold conditions do not present strong technical alignment for either a high-priority BUY or SELL.",

However, key momentum indicators (Williams %R at -92.1, Stochastic K at 7.9, and price near the lower Bollinger Band) are deeply oversold. While the dominant trend is bearish, these oversold conditions suggest a high probability of a short-term bounce or reversal. In \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\", prioritizing capital preservation and demanding multiple confirming indicators, the conflicting signals (strong bearish trend vs. oversold short-term momentum) lead to a lack of strong technical alignment for an immediate trade.

However, the stock is currently in a deeply oversold condition, indicated by a low RSI (34.6), extremely low Williams %R (-86.3), and oversold Stochastic K and D values (13.7 and 14.9). The price is also at the lower Bollinger Band. In 'BALANCED TRADING MODE', we prioritize capital preservation and demand multiple confirming indicators. While the trend is bearish, the oversold state acts as a significant disconfirming indicator for an immediate SELL, suggesting a potential short-term bounce or consolidation. A high-priority BUY is ruled out due to the dominant bearish trend. Given the conflicting signals between the underlying bearish trend and the immediate oversold condition, combined with the \"HIGH Risk Level\" and the requirement for \"strong technical alignment,\" a HOLD decision is prudent to avoid entering a trade on mixed signals and to preserve capital.

A critical issue is the unavailability of reliable volume data (reported as -1), which significantly impairs the ability to confirm the strength and conviction behind any price movement. Furthermore, momentum indicators like Stochastic K (22.0) and Williams %R (-78.0) are approaching oversold levels. This suggests that the current bearish pressure might be nearing exhaustion, which increases the risk of a short-term bounce against a new short position. Given the missing critical data, the conflicting momentum signals with the overall bearish trend, and the AI's 'MEDIUM' confidence in the bearish trend, high uncertainty makes a trade undesirable under a balanced, risk-averse strategy, thus warranting a HOLD position.",
