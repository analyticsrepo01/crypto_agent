The price is clearly trading above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating a robust short-term uptrend. MACD shows sustained upward momentum with a positive histogram and the MACD line above its signal. Crucially, the Volume Ratio is an astounding 30,760,377.97x average, signifying immense buying pressure and confirming the strong momentum, which is a primary trigger for aggressive trading. Although Stochastic K and Williams %R are in overbought territory, in aggressive crypto trading, these often indicate continued strength rather than an immediate reversal, especially when supported by other strong bullish signals. The AI Trend analysis further reinforces this with a HIGH confidence BULLISH trend. With the current position already profitable and a technical score of 10, adding to the position aligns with maximizing profit in an aggressive, momentum-driven strategy.",10.0,HIGH,BULLISH,HIGH,MEDIUM,50.0,107753.925,107332.5124,2.7041996891458098,0.0,30760377.973206453,AGGRESSIVE

The loss of 0.083% is well below the 2% stop-loss trigger. Mandatory fee-aware sell rules strictly prohibit selling an unprofitable position unless it's an emergency stop-loss. While aggressive trading normally demands decisive action on such strong negative momentum (further amplified by significantly high volume ratio of 33988x, suggesting strong selling pressure), the profitability constraint overrides this. The presence of extremely oversold indicators like Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) offers a slim potential for a short-term bounce, but the dominant trend remains bearish.

Current volume is exceptionally high at 5,000,000, confirming the strength of the positive price movement. The AI Trend Analysis explicitly confirms a BULLISH trend, noting ""upward momentum with bullish MACD and high volume on positive movement, trading above key moving averages."" While MACD values are near zero, the AI's interpretation and the other strong indicators support a bullish bias. RSI is at a neutral 50.0, suggesting ample room for further upside without being immediately overbought, thus mitigating the AI's ""overbought"" concern. With a calculated technical score of 5, this meets the aggressive trading mode's actionable BUY threshold (4+). No news sentiment is available to impact this technical decision.
