Despite the current price being above SMA 20 and SMA 50, and an oversold RSI (23.5), critical momentum indicators are flashing strong bearish signals. The MACD histogram (-67.291) and MACD line (-79.885) are deeply negative and show significant divergence from the signal line, indicating strong downward momentum and underlying selling pressure. Furthermore, the Stochastic K (74.1) is approaching overbought conditions, suggesting limited potential for further upside. The AI trend analysis confirms this conflict, labeling the trend as 'BULLISH' but with 'LOW' confidence and 'HIGH' risk, directly citing the 'strongly bearish MACD and overbought stochastics' as weakening factors. In aggressive trading mode, maximizing profit through decisive action and being quick to exit on technical signals is paramount.
