The current price is trading above both the 5-minute SMA 20 ($2482.30) and SMA 50 ($2482.03), signaling an upward trend. MACD shows a bullish crossover (MACD Line 0.075 > Signal 0.048) with a positive histogram (0.026), confirming strong bullish momentum. Volume is exceptionally high (77,569,676) at 710950.18x its average, providing robust confirmation for the buying pressure. While Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are nearing overbought territory, in an aggressive crypto trading mode, this often signifies strong continuing momentum to be capitalized on, especially when backed by such significant volume. The daily change is positive (+0.10%). As per aggressive trading rules, we prioritize momentum and volume indicators to maximize profit with decisive action. Although 1-hour data is unavailable, the compelling 5-minute signals and strong volume align with the aggressive strategy.

The current loss of 0.083% is well below the 2% stop-loss threshold. Despite the inability to sell at a profit, strong bullish technical signals suggest an imminent upward reversal. Momentum indicators Stochastic K (3.7) and Williams %R (-96.3) are extremely oversold, signaling a potential bounce. MACD shows a bullish crossover (Line 0.002 > Signal -0.001, Hist 0.003). Crucially, volume is exceptionally high (34158.01x average), confirming strong market interest.

Furthermore, the AI Trend Analysis, despite labeling the trend as BULLISH, explicitly warns of an ""overbought condition"" and ""potential for a near-term pullback."" This suggests that buying more at the current price might lead to a suboptimal entry for an aggressive trading strategy aiming to maximize profit.
