Crucially, the current volume is an extraordinary 29 million times the average, providing strong confirmation for this bullish surge.

The asset is profoundly oversold on the 5-minute timeframe, indicated by RSI (14.6), Williams %R (-100.0), and Stochastic K (0.0).

This oversold condition is occurring amidst an astronomical volume surge (34304.88x average volume), confirming significant market activity and high potential for a sharp bounce. While the MACD histogram and line are currently slightly negative, their values are minimal, suggesting that a bullish crossover could occur rapidly if a rebound initiates. The AI trend analysis also confirms a BULLISH outlook, explicitly citing the extreme oversold state. Despite the lack of 1-hour data, the confluence of extreme oversold indicators and massive volume on the short-term chart, coupled with the aggressive trading mandate to maximize profit and accept higher risk, strongly advocates for a decisive BUY action.
