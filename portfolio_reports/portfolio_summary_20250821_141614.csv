Price is firmly above both SMA 20 and SMA 50, showcasing a robust uptrend and a golden cross formation. The MACD line is above its signal line with a strongly positive and increasing histogram, confirming strong bullish momentum. RSI at 66.7 and Stochastic K at 80.0 indicate strong buying pressure, and while approaching overbought, these levels are considered strong signals for crypto within normal ranges, not extreme overextension. Williams %R at -20.0 further supports this bullish sentiment. Critically, the current volume is exceptionally high (78,804,681) with a staggering Volume Ratio of 31,154,103.96x average, confirming massive market interest and participation in the bullish move. The AI Trend Analysis explicitly confirms a ""BULLISH"" trend with ""HIGH Confidence"" based on these aligned indicators.
