It has 4.5 bullish signals supporting the move. No news sentiment contradicts this. However, the AI Trend confidence is LOW, and the MACD Histogram is slightly negative, indicating some mixed signals despite the overall bullish score. In a balanced mode, this reduces the overall 'strong technical alignment' for a high priority trade, making a MEDIUM priority more appropriate, especially when compared to TSLA's higher conviction signals.",N/A,354.88,354.88,93,Filled,1.0,0.0,354.98,1.019231,992.47,304.2600000000001,3
