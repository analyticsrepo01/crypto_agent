Volume is exceptionally high (15.2M times average), providing strong confirmation for this upward movement. Crucially, short-term momentum indicators like RSI (32.5), Williams %R (-90.4), and Stochastic K (9.6) are all deeply oversold, suggesting an imminent bounce or continuation of the rally from these levels. The AI trend analysis also confirms a BULLISH outlook. While MACD is currently bearish, the confluence of extreme oversold conditions in other oscillators, high volume, and price action above key moving averages provides a strong aggressive BUY signal, capitalizing on a potential rebound within the established trend. The existing position, while currently unprofitable to sell due to fees, is at the purchase price, not a stop-loss trigger, allowing for aggressive accumulation based on current strong signals.",8.0,HIGH,BULLISH,MEDIUM,HIGH,32.48961619747266,105630.383,106908.8206,-434.23952486984297,4.216883325495304,15268161.80839507,AGGRESSIVE

The price is trading above both the SMA 20 ($2482.05) and SMA 50 ($2482.03), indicating a clear short-term uptrend. The MACD shows bullish momentum with a positive histogram (0.158) and the MACD line (0.186) above the signal line (0.028), confirming the upward thrust. Critically, the Volume Ratio is an astounding 720213.75x average, signifying an exceptionally strong surge in buying interest and momentum, which is a key priority in AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE. While RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic K are in oversold territory, this could suggest a consolidation before a further move up or a potential bounce, rather than a bearish reversal, especially given the overwhelming volume. The AI trend analysis also confirms a 'BULLISH' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence. As per aggressive trading rules, a technical score of 4+ is actionable for BUY.

The volume is exceptionally high (34395x average), indicating strong market interest and potential for significant upward movement.

While MACD is slightly bearish, its value is negligible and overshadowed by the dominant oversold momentum and extreme volume.
