Price ($2482.93) is strongly positioned above both the SMA 20 ($2481.93) and SMA 50 ($2481.93), indicating a clear short-term uptrend. MACD confirms robust bullish momentum, with the MACD line (0.082) well above the signal line (0.001) and a positive histogram (0.081).

Volume is exceptionally high (77,472,540, 719333.90x average), providing strong validation for the upward price movement. RSI (57.1) is healthy and not in overbought territory for crypto (>80), suggesting room for further gains.
