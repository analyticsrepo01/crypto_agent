      "reasoning": "The 5-minute timeframe for AAPL shows a short-term bullish trend with price above SMA 20 and SMA 50, and MACD line above its signal line with a positive histogram. However, multiple momentum indicators (RSI at 67.2, Williams %R at -16.0, Stochastic K at 84.0) are signaling overbought conditions, indicating potential for a near-term correction or consolidation. Crucially, no 1-hour timeframe data is available, which prevents the required medium-term trend confirmation and dual timeframe alignment for the BALANCED TRADING MODE. This violates the strategy's mandate to \"Weight 1-hour trends MORE heavily\", \"Demand multiple confirming indicators\", and \"Focus on strong technical alignment\" across timeframes, and limits confidence. The extremely high volume ratio also suggests potential for high volatility, which balanced mode aims to avoid. No news data is available to provide additional conviction. Given the overbought short-term momentum and the critical absence of medium-term confirming data, this setup does not meet the \"technical scores 6+\" requirement for a high-priority BUY and poses an elevated risk under a capital preservation strategy.",

      "reasoning": "The lack of 1-hour timeframe data is a critical impediment to performing comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and confirming medium-term trends, which is a core requirement for the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE'. While the 5-minute data shows XOM is extremely oversold on multiple oscillators (RSI 18.5, Williams %R -94.6, Stochastic K 5.4) and the AI trend analysis notes a high potential for a near-term bounce, the short-term trend remains bearish with price trading below bearishly aligned moving averages and negative MACD momentum. This presents conflicting signals: extreme oversold conditions versus an ongoing short-term downtrend. In a balanced trading mode that prioritizes capital preservation, demands strong technical alignment, and requires multiple confirming indicators across timeframes, buying into a counter-trend setup without higher-timeframe confirmation is too risky. The technical criteria for a high-priority BUY (score 6+) are not met due to the absence of medium-term trend validation and the conflicting short-term indicators for a sustained bullish move. No news data is available to influence the decision.",

The MACD histogram is negative, and the MACD line is below its signal line, confirming strong negative momentum. The AI trend analysis also identifies a BEARISH trend with HIGH confidence and HIGH risk level. While momentum oscillators like Williams %R and Stochastic K are in oversold territory, suggesting a potential short-term bounce, the prevailing trend is decidedly bearish. Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of the medium-term trend and contradicts the \"Dual Timeframe Alignment\" requirement for high-confidence trades. The extremely high volume ratio indicates significant activity and potential high volatility, which balanced trading mode advises against. Given the lack of confirming bullish technicals (score far below 6+ for BUY), the absence of positive news, and the high-risk bearish environment without medium-term confirmation, a BUY action is not advisable. Capital preservation in Balanced Trading Mode dictates avoiding trades under such conditions.",

      "reasoning": "The 5-minute timeframe for AMZN shows a bullish trend with price above the SMA 20 ($230.84) and SMA 50 ($230.59), and a weakly bullish MACD crossover. AI trend analysis also identifies a BULLISH trend. However, crucial short-term oscillators (RSI at 79.3, Stochastic K at 73.9, and Williams %R at -26.1) are all deeply in overbought territory. This indicates a high probability of a near-term consolidation or pullback, making it an unfavorable entry point for a BUY, especially under a capital preservation strategy. Furthermore, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents critical medium-term trend confirmation and dual timeframe alignment required for high-confidence trades. Without news sentiment, a key risk assessment factor is also missing. The mixed technical signals, specifically the overbought conditions conflicting with the bullish trend, and the absence of critical higher timeframe data, do not meet the \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\" requirements for strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators needed for a high-priority BUY.",

According to the \"CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES\", a position must not be sold at a loss unless it triggers a stop-loss (2%+ loss), which is not the case here (current loss is approx. 0.1%). Therefore, holding the position is mandated to avoid crystallizing a loss. From a technical perspective, the 5-minute timeframe indicates a bullish trend with the price above key moving averages (SMA 20 & SMA 50) and positive MACD momentum. However, the RSI is in overbought territory (72.9), suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and thus prohibits high-confidence trading actions based on technical alignment, especially a new BUY. The absence of confirming higher-timeframe data, combined with the overbought RSI and the current unprofitable status, makes HOLD the appropriate action.",

While momentum indicators like RSI (11.9), Williams %R (-75.5), and Stochastic K (24.5) are extremely oversold, suggesting a potential short-term bounce, this is occurring within an established downtrend as confirmed by the AI trend analysis (BEARISH, MEDIUM Confidence, HIGH Risk). Crucially, there is NO 1-HOUR TIMEFRAME DATA available, which prevents dual-timeframe analysis and the confirmation of medium-term trends. Our 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' prioritizes capital preservation, demands strong technical alignment, and requires multiple confirming indicators across timeframes for high-priority trades. Without the 1-hour data, we cannot achieve the necessary 'Timeframe Alignment' or 'High Confidence' for a directional trade. A buy under these conditions would be against a bearish trend, relying solely on short-term oversold conditions without broader trend confirmation. The lack of news data also removes a critical risk assessment factor. Given the conflicting signals (bearish trend vs. oversold momentum) and the absence of essential medium-term data, a trade cannot meet the requirements for a high or even medium priority BUY, and capital preservation dictates waiting for clearer signals or dual-timeframe alignment.",

However, multiple momentum indicators, including RSI (81.1), Williams %R (-16.4), and Stochastic K (83.6), are all in extremely overbought territory. The AI trend analysis confirms a bullish trend but explicitly highlights a \"HIGH\" risk level and a \"high probability of a near-term pullback\" due to these overbought conditions. In Balanced Trading Mode, capital preservation is prioritized, and trades are avoided during high volatility or when conflicting technical signals exist. Entering a BUY position into extremely overbought conditions contradicts the strategy's focus on strong technical alignment and risk management, as it increases the likelihood of a pullback immediately post-entry. Furthermore, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents the necessary dual timeframe confirmation required for a high-priority directional trade.

While MACD and SMA signals show recent bullish momentum, the overriding overbought conditions and the AI's BEARISH trend with HIGH Risk Level assessment strongly contradict a safe entry for a BUY. This setup does not provide the \"multiple confirming indicators\" or \"strong technical alignment\" required for a high-priority BUY in a balanced trading mode, which prioritizes capital preservation and avoids trades during high volatility.

While momentum indicators (RSI at 25.1, Williams %R at -77.4, Stochastic K at 22.6) suggest the stock is oversold and could potentially bounce, there is no strong technical alignment for a bullish reversal. The 'Balanced Trading Mode' prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators with strong technical alignment, which are absent due to these conflicting signals. Furthermore, the lack of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and trend confirmation, significantly reducing confidence in any directional trade. With no news sentiment available to provide additional context or risk assessment, and the overall technical picture being mixed with a bearish bias, initiating a new position (BUY) is not aligned with the strategy's risk-averse nature.",

While the 5-minute timeframe indicates a bearish trend with price below both the 20 and 50-period Simple Moving Averages, and a negative MACD line and histogram, suggesting bearish momentum, several key momentum oscillators are deeply oversold. The RSI (22.7), Williams %R (-81.1), and Stochastic K (18.9) all fall into extremely oversold territory, which typically suggests a potential for a short-term rebound or a pause in the downtrend. Crucially, 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, which significantly limits our ability to confirm the broader trend and achieve the \"high confidence\" required by the strategy when both timeframes agree. The AI Trend Analysis also highlights this conflict by stating a \"BEARISH\" trend but noting the \"deeply oversold\" momentum indicators. Given the balanced trading mode's emphasis on capital preservation, demanding multiple confirming indicators, and strong technical alignment, the current mixed signals and the absence of a crucial medium-term trend confirmation (1-hour data) make initiating a position too risky. No news data is available to either confirm or contradict a trade. Therefore, holding is the most prudent action until clearer technical alignment emerges across multiple timeframes.",

Crucially, no 1-hour timeframe data is available, which prevents the required medium-term trend confirmation and dual timeframe alignment for the BALANCED TRADING MODE. This violates the strategy's mandate to \"Weight 1-hour trends MORE heavily\", \"Demand multiple confirming indicators\", and \"Focus on strong technical alignment\" across timeframes, and limits confidence. The extremely high volume ratio also suggests potential for high volatility, which balanced mode aims to avoid. No news data is available to provide additional conviction.

This presents conflicting signals: extreme oversold conditions versus an ongoing short-term downtrend. In a balanced trading mode that prioritizes capital preservation, demands strong technical alignment, and requires multiple confirming indicators across timeframes, buying into a counter-trend setup without higher-timeframe confirmation is too risky. The technical criteria for a high-priority BUY (score 6+) are not met due to the absence of medium-term trend validation and the conflicting short-term indicators for a sustained bullish move.

The AI trend analysis also identifies a BEARISH trend with HIGH confidence and HIGH risk level. While momentum oscillators like Williams %R and Stochastic K are in oversold territory, suggesting a potential short-term bounce, the prevailing trend is decidedly bearish. Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of the medium-term trend and contradicts the \"Dual Timeframe Alignment\" requirement for high-confidence trades. The extremely high volume ratio indicates significant activity and potential high volatility, which balanced trading mode advises against.

This indicates a high probability of a near-term consolidation or pullback, making it an unfavorable entry point for a BUY, especially under a capital preservation strategy. Furthermore, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents critical medium-term trend confirmation and dual timeframe alignment required for high-confidence trades. Without news sentiment, a key risk assessment factor is also missing.

Therefore, holding the position is mandated to avoid crystallizing a loss. From a technical perspective, the 5-minute timeframe indicates a bullish trend with the price above key moving averages (SMA 20 & SMA 50) and positive MACD momentum. However, the RSI is in overbought territory (72.9), suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and thus prohibits high-confidence trading actions based on technical alignment, especially a new BUY.

Crucially, there is NO 1-HOUR TIMEFRAME DATA available, which prevents dual-timeframe analysis and the confirmation of medium-term trends. Our 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' prioritizes capital preservation, demands strong technical alignment, and requires multiple confirming indicators across timeframes for high-priority trades. Without the 1-hour data, we cannot achieve the necessary 'Timeframe Alignment' or 'High Confidence' for a directional trade. A buy under these conditions would be against a bearish trend, relying solely on short-term oversold conditions without broader trend confirmation. The lack of news data also removes a critical risk assessment factor.

The AI trend analysis confirms a bullish trend but explicitly highlights a \"HIGH\" risk level and a \"high probability of a near-term pullback\" due to these overbought conditions. In Balanced Trading Mode, capital preservation is prioritized, and trades are avoided during high volatility or when conflicting technical signals exist. Entering a BUY position into extremely overbought conditions contradicts the strategy's focus on strong technical alignment and risk management, as it increases the likelihood of a pullback immediately post-entry.

Crucially, 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, which significantly limits our ability to confirm the broader trend and achieve the \"high confidence\" required by the strategy when both timeframes agree. The AI Trend Analysis also highlights this conflict by stating a \"BEARISH\" trend but noting the \"deeply oversold\" momentum indicators. Given the balanced trading mode's emphasis on capital preservation, demanding multiple confirming indicators, and strong technical alignment, the current mixed signals and the absence of a crucial medium-term trend confirmation (1-hour data) make initiating a position too risky.

This violates the strategy's mandate to \"Weight 1-hour trends MORE heavily\", \"Demand multiple confirming indicators\", and \"Focus on strong technical alignment\" across timeframes, and limits confidence. The extremely high volume ratio also suggests potential for high volatility, which balanced mode aims to avoid. No news data is available to provide additional conviction.

This presents conflicting signals: extreme oversold conditions versus an ongoing short-term downtrend. In a balanced trading mode that prioritizes capital preservation, demands strong technical alignment, and requires multiple confirming indicators across timeframes, buying into a counter-trend setup without higher-timeframe confirmation is too risky. The technical criteria for a high-priority BUY (score 6+) are not met due to the absence of medium-term trend validation and the conflicting short-term indicators for a sustained bullish move.

The AI trend analysis also identifies a BEARISH trend with HIGH confidence and HIGH risk level.

The extremely high volume ratio indicates significant activity and potential high volatility, which balanced trading mode advises against.

However, multiple momentum indicators, including RSI (81.1), Williams %R (-16.4), and Stochastic K (83.6), are all in extremely overbought territory. The AI trend analysis confirms a bullish trend but explicitly highlights a \"HIGH\" risk level and a \"high probability of a near-term pullback\" due to these overbought conditions. In Balanced Trading Mode, capital preservation is prioritized, and trades are avoided during high volatility or when conflicting technical signals exist. Entering a BUY position into extremely overbought conditions contradicts the strategy's focus on strong technical alignment and risk management, as it increases the likelihood of a pullback immediately post-entry. Furthermore, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents the necessary dual timeframe confirmation required for a high-priority directional trade.

While momentum indicators (RSI at 25.1, Williams %R at -77.4, Stochastic K at 22.6) suggest the stock is oversold and could potentially bounce, there is no strong technical alignment for a bullish reversal. The 'Balanced Trading Mode' prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators with strong technical alignment, which are absent due to these conflicting signals. Furthermore, the lack of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and trend confirmation, significantly reducing confidence in any directional trade. With no news sentiment available to provide additional context or risk assessment, and the overall technical picture being mixed with a bearish bias, initiating a new position (BUY) is not aligned with the strategy's risk-averse nature.",

While the 5-minute timeframe indicates a bearish trend with price below both the 20 and 50-period Simple Moving Averages, and a negative MACD line and histogram, suggesting bearish momentum, several key momentum oscillators are deeply oversold. The RSI (22.7), Williams %R (-81.1), and Stochastic K (18.9) all fall into extremely oversold territory, which typically suggests a potential for a short-term rebound or a pause in the downtrend. Crucially, 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, which significantly limits our ability to confirm the broader trend and achieve the \"high confidence\" required by the strategy when both timeframes agree. The AI Trend Analysis also highlights this conflict by stating a \"BEARISH\" trend but noting the \"deeply oversold\" momentum indicators. Given the balanced trading mode's emphasis on capital preservation, demanding multiple confirming indicators, and strong technical alignment, the current mixed signals and the absence of a crucial medium-term trend confirmation (1-hour data) make initiating a position too risky. No news data is available to either confirm or contradict a trade. Therefore, holding is the most prudent action until clearer technical alignment emerges across multiple timeframes.",
