Price is trading below both the SMA 20 ($107770.10) and SMA 50 ($107764.71). The MACD shows a bearish crossover (Line: -2.404, Signal: 2.176) with a negative and declining histogram (-4.580), indicating strong downward momentum. The AI Trend Analysis reinforces this with a HIGH confidence BEARISH trend, attributing it to strong selling pressure confirmed by high volume during negative price movement. While these technicals suggest a strong sell signal, the current BTCUSD long position is explicitly ""❌ UNPROFITABLE to sell"" with a Net P&L After Fees of $-0.01. As per the mandatory critical fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position cannot be sold unless it triggers a 2%+ stop-loss, which this does not.

Furthermore, key oscillators like Stochastic K (80.0) and Williams %R (-20.0) are in the overbought zone, suggesting potential for a downward reversal or continued consolidation.
