While the price is still above the SMA 20 and SMA 50, suggesting some structural support, the weakening momentum indicated by MACD, Williams %R (-60.8), and Stochastic K (39.2) suggests a potential short-term reversal or pull-back. Given the mandate to maximize profit through decisive action and to be quick to exit based on technical signals, taking profits now on a weakening momentum signal is prudent, especially with no positive news to confirm continued upside.

While the price is currently below its short-term SMAs and the AI trend analysis indicates NEUTRAL with MEDIUM confidence due to these conflicting signals (bullish momentum vs. bearish short-term price action), the aggressive strategy dictates accepting higher risk for higher potential returns and prioritizing these strong momentum signals.
