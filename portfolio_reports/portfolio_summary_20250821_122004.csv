According to the mandatory fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position must be held unless a stop-loss (2%+ loss) is triggered, which is not the case here. While aggressive trading normally favors quick exits on negative signals, the paramount rule to avoid selling at a loss takes precedence for the existing position. Holding allows for potential price recovery to mitigate the current unrealized loss and avoid locking in a definite loss from fees.

While a high current volume is reported, its presence with zero price change suggests a data anomaly or a trading halt, not active, actionable trading. Crucially, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents any medium-term trend confirmation, which is weighted more heavily in the decision process. In an AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, quick action relies on clear momentum and strong technical signals (BUY at 4+). Given the current static data, zero volatility, and lack of actionable signals, there is no technical basis to initiate a BUY.
