The current price displays an unusual 0.00% daily change, indicating extreme stagnation or a potential data anomaly, which fundamentally challenges any reliable directional analysis despite high reported volume and volatility metrics (ATR, 20-day volatility). Technical indicators present conflicting signals: the price is above both SMA 20 and SMA 50, with SMA 20 above SMA 50, typically a bullish alignment. However, momentum indicators like MACD show a bearish crossover (MACD Line below MACD Signal) and a negative histogram, suggesting a loss of upward momentum. RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic K are all in neutral territory. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this ambiguity, classifying the trend as ""NEUTRAL"" with ""LOW"" confidence and ""MEDIUM"" risk due to contradictory signals and the absence of clear price movement.
