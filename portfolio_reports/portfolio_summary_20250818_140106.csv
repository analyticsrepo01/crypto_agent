Even if capital were available, initiating a BUY trade would not align with the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE ACTIVE' rules. While several technical indicators like price being above all key moving averages (SMA 20, 50; EMA 12, 26), a positive MACD crossover, and bullish Stochastic readings indicate short-term momentum, the stock exhibits strong overbought conditions with an RSI of 77.0. The AI trend analysis further corroborates this, identifying the trend as BULLISH but with a ""HIGH"" risk level due to ""overextended"" bullishness and a potential ""risk of consolidation or pullback."" This mixed signal, particularly the significant overbought condition, contradicts the strategy's requirement for strong technical alignment, capital preservation, and avoiding trades during high volatility.

The overall technical score of 3 indicates a strong bearish bias, which would typically align with a SELL recommendation (scores 4- for high-priority SELL in Balanced Trading Mode). However, a BUY action is not possible due to insufficient available cash ($132.94) to purchase 1 share of META ($765.46) while maintaining the $100 minimum cash reserve.
