According to the MANDATORY CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, I must recommend HOLD unless it's a stop-loss trigger (which is not met or defined as a percentage loss for this small negative P&L). Technically, BTCUSD exhibits extremely overbought conditions across multiple momentum indicators on the 5-minute timeframe (RSI 88.4, Stochastic K 98.2, Williams %R -1.8), which in crypto markets are strong signals for an imminent reversal or correction. This is further supported by the AI Trend Analysis, which identifies a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence, specifically citing these overbought conditions and high volume on negative price movement. Despite the current price being above SMA 20 and SMA 50, these divergences strongly suggest a downturn is likely. However, due to the mandatory profitability rule for selling, the only compliant action is to hold the current position and await either a price recovery for a profitable exit or a clear stop-loss trigger.",3.0,MEDIUM,BEARISH,MEDIUM,HIGH,88.44432467528387,105717.3375,106207.5378,289.8809760434506,-0.10000201284080912,21932770.313027542,AGGRESSIVE

The MACD Line (0.100) is firmly above the Signal Line (0.049) with a positive histogram (0.051), indicating robust buying pressure and an accelerating uptrend. Price is trading above key moving averages (SMA 20 at $2482.30 is above SMA 50 at $2481.93), confirming a short-term bullish trend. Critically, current volume (77,784,019) is extraordinarily high at 710554.86x the average, providing powerful confirmation for the bullish price action and momentum, which is a key priority for this aggressive mode. While momentum oscillators like Williams %R (-20.1) and Stochastic K (79.9) are nearing overbought levels, RSI (55.6) remains neutral-bullish, and for crypto, these signals are not considered critical sell triggers unless extreme (>80 for RSI).

The AI trend analysis confirms a BULLISH outlook, specifically citing these oversold indicators. Furthermore, the current volume is exceptionally high (Volume Ratio 1977066.03x average), indicating strong market interest and the potential for a significant price surge from these levels.

Crucially, current volume (32,426,550) is an astonishing 34049.24x the average volume, signaling extremely strong conviction and robust upward momentum, which is a key priority in aggressive trading. Although Williams %R (-0.0) and Stochastic K (100.0) suggest overbought conditions in the 5-minute timeframe, in crypto markets, these can indicate sustained strong momentum rather than an immediate reversal, especially given the neutral RSI (50.0). Our aggressive trading mode prioritizes momentum and volume. With no 1-hour data available, we must rely on the strong 5-minute indicators and the AI's high confidence for trend direction.
