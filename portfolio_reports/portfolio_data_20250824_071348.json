Therefore, as per critical fee-aware sell rules, the current position MUST be held. While a new trade would be considered based purely on technicals, the underlying analysis presents mixed but predominantly bearish signals. The AI Trend Analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence, citing price trading below all short-term moving averages, a bearish SMA crossover, and critically, \"high negative volume\" which is highly prioritized in aggressive mode. This culminates in an overall 'WEAK_BEARISH' technical score from the AI. Despite a bullish MACD crossover, positive MACD histogram, and overbought momentum indicators (Stochastic K at 80.0, Williams %R at -20.0, indicating strong recent upward pressure that may be nearing exhaustion), the overriding bearish trend from price action and the AI's volume interpretation prevents a BUY recommendation. Given the mandatory HOLD for the existing unprofitable position, no new BUYs are advised, and a SELL action is prohibited for the current shares.",

Furthermore, the current holding of 5.4015 shares exceeds the 'Max shares per stock: 5' constraint, making a SELL action necessary to bring the portfolio back into compliance. Technical analysis presents conflicting signals: MACD shows a bearish cross and negative histogram (bearish), while Williams %R and Stochastic K are at extreme oversold levels (potential bullish reversal). However, the price action exhibits extreme flatness (+0.00% daily change) with an AI trend analysis indicating NEUTRAL trend, LOW confidence, and HIGH risk. Despite an extremely high volume ratio (34112.06x average), which signals significant activity and potential for a large move, the lack of directional price movement combined with a bearish MACD and the AI's high-risk assessment suggests caution. In an AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, taking a guaranteed profit from an oversized, profitable position amidst conflicting signals and high risk is a decisive action to maximize profit and manage exposure, especially when bearish momentum (MACD) is present.",

Per the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, I am mandated to recommend HOLD unless there is an emergency stop-loss trigger, which is not present. Furthermore, for considering any new trades (BUY or additional SELL), the technical analysis is severely compromised by missing data, including \"nan\" for Williams %R and Stochastic K, and \"0\" values for MACD Histogram, MACD Line, MACD Signal, Volume MA, ATR, and 20-day Volatility. While the current price ($577.66) is above the SMA 20 ($575.53) and SMA 50 ($575.53), and current volume is high (5,000,000), these bullish indicators are undermined by neutral RSI (50.0) and MACD values (0.000). The AI Trend Analysis indicates BULLISH but with \"LOW Confidence\" and \"HIGH Risk,\" and its reasoning contains contradictions with the raw data (e.g., claiming a bullish MACD signal when raw data shows 0.000). Based on the available data, the technical score is approximately 3.5, which does not meet the \"4+\" threshold for a BUY action in aggressive mode, nor does it meet the \"6-\" threshold for a SELL action. The lack of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual timeframe analysis. Without clear and reliable technical signals, combined with the mandatory HOLD rule for the existing unprofitable position, no new aggressive action is warranted.",

Therefore, as per critical fee-aware sell rules, the current position MUST be held. While a new trade would be considered based purely on technicals, the underlying analysis presents mixed but predominantly bearish signals. The AI Trend Analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence, citing price trading below all short-term moving averages, a bearish SMA crossover, and critically, \"high negative volume\" which is highly prioritized in aggressive mode. This culminates in an overall 'WEAK_BEARISH' technical score from the AI. Despite a bullish MACD crossover, positive MACD histogram, and overbought momentum indicators (Stochastic K at 80.0, Williams %R at -20.0, indicating strong recent upward pressure that may be nearing exhaustion), the overriding bearish trend from price action and the AI's volume interpretation prevents a BUY recommendation. Given the mandatory HOLD for the existing unprofitable position, no new BUYs are advised, and a SELL action is prohibited for the current shares.",

However, the price action exhibits extreme flatness (+0.00% daily change) with an AI trend analysis indicating NEUTRAL trend, LOW confidence, and HIGH risk. Despite an extremely high volume ratio (34112.06x average), which signals significant activity and potential for a large move, the lack of directional price movement combined with a bearish MACD and the AI's high-risk assessment suggests caution.

Per the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, I am mandated to recommend HOLD unless there is an emergency stop-loss trigger, which is not present. Furthermore, for considering any new trades (BUY or additional SELL), the technical analysis is severely compromised by missing data, including \"nan\" for Williams %R and Stochastic K, and \"0\" values for MACD Histogram, MACD Line, MACD Signal, Volume MA, ATR, and 20-day Volatility. While the current price ($577.66) is above the SMA 20 ($575.53) and SMA 50 ($575.53), and current volume is high (5,000,000), these bullish indicators are undermined by neutral RSI (50.0) and MACD values (0.000). The AI Trend Analysis indicates BULLISH but with \"LOW Confidence\" and \"HIGH Risk,\" and its reasoning contains contradictions with the raw data (e.g., claiming a bullish MACD signal when raw data shows 0.000). Based on the available data, the technical score is approximately 3.5, which does not meet the \"4+\" threshold for a BUY action in aggressive mode, nor does it meet the \"6-\" threshold for a SELL action. The lack of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual timeframe analysis. Without clear and reliable technical signals, combined with the mandatory HOLD rule for the existing unprofitable position, no new aggressive action is warranted.",

Therefore, the immediate action for the existing position must be HOLD. From a technical perspective, the 5-minute timeframe shows short-term bullish momentum with price above SMAs and a positive MACD crossover. However, this is heavily counterbalanced by extremely overbought conditions across all key momentum indicators: RSI is 90.9, Williams %R is -0.0, and Stochastic K is 100.0. In crypto, RSI > 80 signals are particularly strong for an imminent bearish correction. The AI Trend analysis confirms a BEARISH outlook with MEDIUM confidence and HIGH risk, explicitly citing this overextension as a signal for significant downside risk. The extremely high current volume (21M x average) further indicates significant activity which often precedes corrections at extreme levels. While these underlying technicals would strongly indicate a SELL for a new position due to the high probability of a bearish correction, the existing unprofitable position dictates a HOLD to avoid crystallizing losses and incurring fees, awaiting either a price recovery or a stop-loss trigger.

The current price ($2482.92) is trading above both the 5-minute SMA 20 ($2482.18) and SMA 50 ($2481.88), indicating an uptrend. Momentum indicators Williams %R (-20.1) and Stochastic K (79.9) are in near overbought territory, signaling powerful buying pressure. Crucially, current volume (77,795,975) is orders of magnitude above its moving average (Volume Ratio 716987.99x), strongly confirming heightened interest and validating the bullish move. While the MACD histogram and line suggest a bearish crossover or continuation, the overwhelming strength from volume and momentum, coupled with the AI's BULLISH trend analysis (medium confidence), justifies a BUY. In aggressive mode, priority is given to momentum and volume. The existing position of 0.060413999999999995 shares, currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L $-0.01 after fees), will be held as per mandatory fee-aware sell rules; this BUY action is for adding new shares to capitalize on the strong upward momentum.

Despite an underlying bullish trend and high volume, key short-term momentum indicators (Stochastic K and Williams %R) are at 100, signaling extreme overbought conditions. The AI trend analysis explicitly warns of a \"consolidation phase with potential for a pullback\" due to these overbought indicators and current price flatness. In aggressive trading mode, it is crucial to maximize profit and accept higher risk, which includes taking decisive action to lock in gains when reversal signals are strong, especially when an explicit pullback warning is present. Selling now capitalizes on existing profits and avoids potential downside from a correction. The aggregated technical score of 3 also falls within the \"actionable for SELL\" range (6 or less).",

As per the mandatory fee-aware sell rules, I MUST recommend HOLD unless a stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here (Gross P&L is $0.00). While the AI trend analysis indicates a BULLISH trend with MEDIUM confidence due to positive momentum and high current volume, it also critically warns that the asset is \"currently overbought as indicated by Bollinger Bands, suggesting a potential short-term correction.\" This overbought condition, combined with a neutral RSI (50.0) and flat MACD (0.000), presents conflicting signals that do not support an aggressive new BUY entry at this moment. The price is above SMA 20 and SMA 50, which is positive, but the warning of an impending correction outweighs the immediate bullish momentum for new entries. Therefore, the primary action is to hold the existing unprofitable position and wait for either a clear price recovery to achieve profitability for a potential sell or a stronger, less ambiguous BUY signal for further accumulation.",

The AI trend analysis explicitly warns of the current upward move being \"overextended and highly susceptible to an imminent pullback\" with a \"HIGH Risk\" level. Despite the aggressive trading mode prioritizing momentum, entering a new BUY position at this point carries a very high risk of immediate reversal and potential loss due to the overextension. My refined technical score is around 3.5, which falls below the '4+' threshold for an actionable BUY in aggressive mode, considering the strong warnings from the overbought oscillators. Therefore, it is prudent to HOLD and await either a healthy pullback or a clearer entry signal to maximize profit potential, aligning with the aggressive mode's goal of maximizing profit through decisive action, which includes avoiding high-risk entries at potential tops.",

The AI trend analysis confirms this, identifying an established bullish trend but warning of a high likelihood of a short-term pullback due to these overbought conditions, leading to a NEUTRAL trend assessment with HIGH risk. The lack of 1-hour data prevents medium-term confirmation. Given the conflicting strong momentum versus extreme overbought warnings, and the current technical score of 3.0 being below the actionable BUY threshold of 4+, a new BUY is not advisable, and selling the existing unprofitable position is prohibited.

MACD shows positive momentum with the MACD Line (0.251) above its Signal Line (0.162) and a positive Histogram (0.090). Crucially, the current volume (77,829,831) is exceptionally high at 713071.60x the average, signaling massive buying interest and strong momentum, which is a primary driver in aggressive trading. While Williams %R (-20.1) and Stochastic K (79.9) suggest overbought conditions, indicating potential for short-term consolidation, the overwhelming bullish signals from AI, SMAs, MACD, and particularly the extreme volume, support a strong BUY action in an aggressive, momentum-driven strategy.

In an aggressive trading mode, while we accept higher risk, buying into an overbought condition with weak momentum could lead to immediate pullbacks, hindering profit maximization. Therefore, the most prudent action is to HOLD the current position and wait for clearer trend confirmation or a more favorable entry point, especially since a sell is not profitable.",

The current price ($2482.92) is strongly positioned above both the SMA20 ($2482.43) and SMA50 ($2481.93), with the SMA20 above SMA50, confirming an uptrend. MACD shows positive momentum with the MACD Line (0.251) above its Signal Line (0.162) and a positive Histogram (0.090). Crucially, the current volume (77,829,831) is exceptionally high at 713071.60x the average, signaling massive buying interest and strong momentum, which is a primary driver in aggressive trading. While Williams %R (-20.1) and Stochastic K (79.9) suggest overbought conditions, indicating potential for short-term consolidation, the overwhelming bullish signals from AI, SMAs, MACD, and particularly the extreme volume, support a strong BUY action in an aggressive, momentum-driven strategy. The existing position is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L $-0.01), so it will be held as per the fee-aware sell rules, but a new buy order is warranted given the strong signals and available capital.",

RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic are all in neutral territory, offering no strong directional signals. Furthermore, the extremely high volume ratio (716277.24x average) with no corresponding price movement is anomalous and suggests a data quality issue or a highly controlled, high-risk market environment. Crucially, I am unable to sell the existing position (0.10069 shares @ $2482.92) as it is currently unprofitable (Net P&L: -$0.01) after accounting for trading fees, directly violating the \"CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES\".

The absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a more robust trend confirmation. The overall technical score of 2.5 does not meet the \"4+\" threshold for an aggressive BUY or the \"6-\" threshold for an aggressive SELL. The AI Trend also indicates NEUTRAL with MEDIUM confidence.

MACD exhibits a clear bullish crossover (MACD Line 0.307 > MACD Signal 0.201) with a positive and increasing histogram (0.105), indicating strong upward momentum. Momentum indicators like Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are in the upper range, confirming significant buying pressure. Crucially, current volume (77,826,322) is an astounding 713566.59x the average, providing strong confirmation for the bullish trend. The AI Trend Analysis also confirms a \"BULLISH\" trend with \"HIGH\" confidence.

Despite a strong daily price rally of +4.85% and extremely high current volume (23.8M x average), with the price trading above both 20 and 50-period SMAs, momentum indicators like MACD remain bearish (negative histogram and MACD line below signal). RSI is low at 30.9, but not in the extreme oversold zone to trigger a strong crypto-adjusted BUY signal (<20). The AI trend analysis explicitly rates the overall technical strength as \"NEUTRAL\" with \"MEDIUM\" confidence due to these conflicting underlying momentum indicators. The absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and reduces overall confidence in a strong directional trade. Under aggressive trading mode, clear technical scores (4+ for BUY, 6- for SELL) are required for decisive action; the current mixed signals do not meet these thresholds for a new position.

While aggressive trading prioritizes momentum, the 5-minute analysis presents conflicting signals. There's positive price movement (+0.37%) and extremely high volume (5,000,000x average), which normally suggests strong bullish momentum. However, key short-term indicators like RSI (50.0) and MACD (0.000) are neutral, not confirming a strong buy signal. Crucially, the AI trend analysis, despite noting a BULLISH trend, explicitly warns of an \"overbought condition\" and a \"potential for a near-term pullback.\" Entering a new long position or adding to the existing one under these overbought conditions, with an explicit risk of pullback, would contradict the goal of maximizing profit and unnecessarily increase risk, especially while the current position is unprofitable. Lack of 1-hour data also reduces overall trend confidence. Therefore, the most prudent action is to hold the current position and await clearer, less contradictory signals or a price recovery to ensure profit maximization.",

Technically, the 5-minute timeframe presents conflicting signals: bearish MACD and price below SMAs, but strong oversold conditions (Williams %R -100, Stochastic K 0.0) combined with extremely high volume (34131x average), which in an aggressive crypto trading mode could suggest a potential bounce. However, the rule-based hold due to unprofitability and near max shares overrides other considerations. The AI trend analysis also indicates a NEUTRAL market with conflicting pressures.",

Despite the current price being static with 0.00% daily change and the AI trend analysis showing low confidence and high risk with neutral momentum indicators (RSI, Williams %R, Stochastic K), there are compelling bullish signals aligning with the aggressive trading mode. The MACD histogram (2.316) is positive, and the MACD line (0.288) is above the signal line (-2.028), indicating strong bullish momentum.

This highly unusual volume with a static price could signal significant accumulation before a major price movement.

The price is also below both the SMA 20 ($120.35) and SMA 50 ($120.36), further indicating short-term bearishness.

Analyzing the 5-minute timeframe, bullish signals include the current price ($577.66) being above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50 ($575.53), and an extremely high Current Volume (5,000,000) with a 5000000.00x volume ratio, indicating strong recent interest and potential for momentum. The AI trend analysis also identifies a BULLISH trend. However, there are cautionary signals: the MACD Histogram, Line, and Signal are flat at 0.000, suggesting a lack of strong immediate momentum, and the RSI (14) is neutral at 50.0. The AI trend confidence is LOW, citing ADX 0.0 (indicating a lack of overall trend strength) and warning of a potentially \"unsustainable upward move\" despite the bullish trend (it also mentions being overbought, which conflicts with the neutral RSI). The critical absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a higher-confidence assessment of the medium-term trend. Given the mixed technical signals, the aggressive mode's prioritization of momentum (supported by high volume) is present, but the overall lack of robust, confirmed upward momentum, combined with the mandatory HOLD for an unprofitable position, makes waiting for clearer direction or a return to profitability the most appropriate strategy.",

Furthermore, the exceptionally high Volume Ratio (30720990.41x average) points to significant market interest and potential for upward momentum, crucial for aggressive entries. While MACD shows short-term bearish momentum (negative histogram and MACD line below signal), the overwhelming oversold conditions and strong volume outweigh this, suggesting a high-probability bounce play in line with the AI's \"BULLISH\" trend analysis.

For new trade consideration, the technical analysis presents a mixed and low-confidence picture. While the price is above the 5-minute SMAs and the daily change is positive (+0.37%), the RSI is neutral (50.0), and MACD indicators are flat (0.000), indicating a lack of clear momentum. Critical 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, which significantly prevents trend confirmation and reduces overall confidence, as medium-term trends are weighted more heavily. The AI Trend Analysis confirms this, identifying a \"BULLISH\" trend but with \"LOW Confidence\" and \"HIGH Risk,\" specifically citing inconsistent or zero indicator data (e.g., Volume MA, ATR, Volatility).

Crucially, volume is exceptionally high (Volume Ratio: 30794142.88x average) supporting positive price movement, which is a key priority in aggressive trading. The AI Trend Analysis confirms a BULLISH trend with MEDIUM confidence. While there's a minor bearish MACD crossover, it is significantly outweighed by the robust price action, strong volume, and bullish trend confirmation. As an aggressive trader aiming to maximize profit, acting on these strong momentum signals is paramount. Despite the existing position being marginally unprofitable to sell according to fee rules, the bullish outlook warrants adding to the position to capitalize on the upward trend and potentially bring the overall position into profitability faster.",

Crucially, the current volume is exceptionally high (710123.58x average), confirming the strength and conviction behind this upward movement. The AI trend analysis also confirms a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. Given the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE and the directive to MAXIMIZE PROFIT by accepting higher risk, adding to the current profitable position to capitalize on this strong momentum is warranted.

Momentum indicators Williams %R (-0.0) and Stochastic K (100.0) are in extremely overbought territory, strongly suggesting an imminent downside correction or reversal. While the MACD histogram is slightly positive (0.001), the MACD line (-0.001) and signal (-0.003) are negative, and the overall picture, including the AI trend's reasoning, points to a strong downside risk. An extremely high volume ratio (34175.58x) with flat price action could indicate distribution or an impending significant move, which given the overbought momentum, is more likely to be to the downside.

With only 5-minute data available and no 1-hour trend confirmation, combined with the explicit overbought warning, the overall technical score falls below the actionable BUY threshold of 4+.

Furthermore, the AI Trend Analysis, despite calling the trend BULLISH, explicitly notes \"significant contradictions\" including \"0.00% daily change, absence of a defined trend (ADX=0), zero standard deviation, and bearish OBV,\" concluding it's a \"fragile or developing bullish trend.\" This mixed picture, particularly the lack of actual price movement despite high volume and overbought conditions, does not provide a clear enough \"technical score 4+\" for an aggressive BUY, nor a \"technical score 6-\" for a SELL.

Critically, current volume is an astounding 34165.09x its average, signaling strong buying pressure and momentum. Although Williams %R and Stochastic K show extremely overbought conditions, the AI trend analysis explicitly states these are overridden by the overwhelming strength of the upward trend, which is a key consideration in aggressive crypto trading where strong momentum often pushes past traditional overbought levels.

Current volume is high (5,000,000), but without corresponding price movement or average volume for comparison, it does not confirm a strong trend. The AI trend analysis indicates 'BULLISH' but with 'LOW' confidence and 'HIGH' risk, specifically citing \"significant data gaps\" (e.g., no 1-hour data).

Momentum indicators are signaling overbought conditions, with Stochastic K at 81.8 (well above the crypto-adjusted threshold of 80 for strong overbought) and Williams %R at -18.2 (also in overbought territory), both suggesting an imminent price correction. Furthermore, the MACD has crossed bearishly (MACD Line 1.021 below Signal Line 3.306, with a negative MACD Histogram of -2.285). The AI trend analysis confirms a BEARISH outlook with MEDIUM confidence, attributing it to these overbought momentum indicators and the bearish MACD crossover, despite the current price being marginally above the SMA 20 and SMA 50. Volume is exceptionally high (Volume Ratio: 30638038.88x average), which could amplify any price movement. While the technical signals strongly indicate a SELL for new positions or if the existing position were profitable, the \"CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES\" dictate that a position showing \"\u274c UNPROFITABLE to sell\" (Net P&L After Fees: $-0.01) must be held unless it's an emergency stop-loss, which is not the case here. Therefore, we must HOLD the existing position, refraining from opening new long positions given the bearish outlook.",

Technical analysis for the 5-minute timeframe presents mixed signals: price is above both the SMA 20 ($2481.31) and SMA 50 ($2481.83), suggesting minor bullish pressure. However, MACD (line at -0.399, signal at -0.321, histogram at -0.078) shows bearish momentum. RSI (46.7), Williams %R (-40.1), and Stochastic K (59.9) are all in neutral territory.

Therefore, selling the current position is prohibited. Regarding potential new entries, the 5-minute timeframe shows the price above key moving averages (SMA 20 and SMA 50) and a positive daily change of +0.37%, supported by high current volume. However, the RSI is neutral at 50.0 and MACD indicators are flat at 0.000. Crucially, 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, which significantly impacts our ability to confirm medium-term trends and reduces overall confidence. The AI trend analysis indicates a \"BULLISH\" trend but with \"LOW Confidence\" and a \"HIGH Risk\" level, citing that the asset is \"significantly overbought\" and suggesting a potential short-term correction. Given the aggressive trading mode, a strong and clear signal across both momentum and trend is required for decisive action. The current mixed technicals, lack of 1-hour data, neutral momentum indicators, and the AI's \"overbought\" warning do not provide a sufficiently strong BUY signal (Technical Score not strongly >4) for a new entry. Without positive news as a strong confirmation, and considering the aggressive mode's emphasis on quick entry/exit based on strong signals, the prudent action for the existing unprofitable position is to HOLD and await a more definitive breakout or recovery towards profitability.",

However, the underlying technical analysis for BTCUSD indicates a strong bearish outlook, suggesting high risk for the current long position. The 5-minute MACD shows a bearish crossover (MACD Line 0.961 < Signal 1.280) with a negative histogram (-0.319). Both Stochastic K (81.8) and Williams %R (-18.2) are in overbought territory, signaling a high probability of a downward reversal. Furthermore, the AI Trend Analysis is unequivocally BEARISH with HIGH confidence, explicitly citing these momentum indicators, coupled with the extremely high current volume (78,026,064 vs. MA 3) indicating strong underlying selling pressure.

For new trades, while the 5-minute timeframe shows a weak bullish trend with the price above SMAs and exceptionally high volume (5,000,000), indicating some momentum, the AI trend analysis explicitly states \"LOW Confidence\" and \"HIGH Risk\" due to being \"overbought per Bollinger Bands\" with a potential pullback. The RSI is neutral (50.0) and MACD is at zero, not confirming a strong upward breakout. Given the absence of 1-hour data for trend confirmation and the conflicting signals (bullish trend vs. high risk/low confidence), the technical strength does not meet the \"4+\" threshold for an aggressive BUY, despite the high volume. Therefore, the recommendation is to HOLD the existing position and await clearer, stronger bullish confirmation without the high risk warning before considering adding to the position or for the price to move into a profitable zone for selling.",

The AI trend analysis, despite being BULLISH, has LOW confidence and explicitly notes that this \"weak bullishness is at risk of consolidation or reversal\" due to the overbought conditions.

The AI Trend Analysis confirms a NEUTRAL trend with HIGH confidence, despite extremely high current volume (77,666,039) compared to its MA (109). This suggests consolidation without a clear directional breakout. No 1-hour data is available for medium-term trend confirmation.

Momentum indicators, Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1), are nearing the overbought threshold but reflect powerful buying pressure rather than exhaustion, consistent with strong upward movement in crypto. Crucially for aggressive trading, the Volume Ratio is an extraordinary 716214.08x average, signaling massive market interest and strong conviction, which highly validates the bullish price action and indicates a high-momentum opportunity. Although 1-hour data is unavailable, the overwhelming short-term technical strength, particularly the exceptional volume, justifies an aggressive BUY action to maximize profit. The existing position in ETHUSD (0.301964 shares @ $2483.75) is currently unprofitable (Net P&L: $-0.26) and does not meet the 2%+ stop-loss threshold, therefore it is mandated to HOLD according to critical fee-aware sell rules, separate from this new BUY recommendation.",

The extremely high volume with no corresponding price change further reinforces the current lack of clear market direction.

Crucially for aggressive trading, the Volume Ratio is an extraordinary 716214.08x average, signaling massive market interest and strong conviction, which highly validates the bullish price action and indicates a high-momentum opportunity. Although 1-hour data is unavailable, the overwhelming short-term technical strength, particularly the exceptional volume, justifies an aggressive BUY action to maximize profit. The existing position in ETHUSD (0.301964 shares @ $2483.75) is currently unprofitable (Net P&L: $-0.26) and does not meet the 2%+ stop-loss threshold, therefore it is mandated to HOLD according to critical fee-aware sell rules, separate from this new BUY recommendation.",

The extremely high volume with no corresponding price change further reinforces the current lack of clear market direction. In AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, tying up capital in a maxed-out, stagnant, but profitable position is inefficient. Selling now allows us to realize profit and redeploy capital into more dynamic opportunities, aligning with the \"maximize profit\" and \"quick to enter/exit\" directives.",

The current position of 0.00510355 shares exceeds the \"Max shares per stock: 5\" constraint (interpreted as 0.005 units given 0.001 trade size). Furthermore, a SELL action is prohibited as the current position is explicitly marked as \"\u274c UNPROFITABLE to sell\" (Net P&L $-0.01) and does not meet the 2%+ stop-loss trigger.

Both Williams %R at -20.0 and Stochastic K at 80.0 are in overbought territory, which in an aggressive crypto trading context signifies robust momentum rather than an immediate reversal. Crucially, the current volume is exceptionally high, with a Volume Ratio of 31319722.28x average, indicating significant market interest and strong conviction behind the upward move, which is a primary focus for aggressive trading. The AI Trend Analysis also confirms a BULLISH outlook with medium confidence. While 1-hour data is unavailable, limiting medium-term trend confirmation, the overwhelming short-term momentum and volume signals justify a decisive BUY. Although the current small position is unprofitable to sell, this recommendation is to capitalize on the strong upward momentum by adding to the position, aligning with the aggressive mode's objective to maximize profit by accepting higher risk in pursuit of higher returns.",

Critically, the current volume is extraordinarily high (717677.61x the average), which is a powerful confirmation of strong buying interest and momentum, a key factor in aggressive trading. The AI trend analysis further reinforces this by identifying a BULLISH trend with medium confidence.

Therefore, an immediate SELL is not permissible, and the position must be held. For new trades, the 5-minute analysis presents conflicting signals. While momentum oscillators Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are extremely oversold, indicating a high potential for an upward reversal (a strong aggressive BUY signal in crypto), the MACD histogram (-0.004), MACD line (-0.005), and price ($120.30) trading below both SMA 20 ($120.36) and SMA 50 ($120.36) indicate a short-term bearish trend. The AI Trend Analysis confirms a \"BEARISH\" trend with \"MEDIUM\" confidence, noting \"high volume on negative price movement\" further indicating selling pressure, despite acknowledging the potential for reversals from oversold indicators. Without 1-hour data to confirm a higher timeframe trend, and with the AI's primary assessment being bearish, the mixed technical signals do not provide a strong enough technical score (below 4+) to initiate a new BUY order, even in aggressive mode.

The 5-minute data shows the price above SMAs, which is bullish, but RSI and MACD are neutral (0.000). Volume and volatility indicators are unreliable or zero. The AI trend analysis, while labeling the trend BULLISH, has LOW confidence and explicitly warns of an \"overbought condition\" signaling a potential pullback.

However, the price is currently holding above the 20 and 50-period Simple Moving Averages, and the AI confidence is low. High volume suggests active trading, but the direction remains ambiguous without 1-hour confirmation.

While there are minor bullish signals from the MACD (line above signal, slightly positive histogram) and price position relative to SMAs (above SMA20 and SMA50), key momentum indicators like RSI, Stochastic K, and Williams %R are all neutral (~50). The extremely high current volume relative to its moving average, without any price movement, suggests a lack of clear directional conviction or strong momentum, which is critical for aggressive trading. Under AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, the absence of strong, discernible momentum negates immediate high-profit entry opportunities. Furthermore, the current position is \u274c UNPROFITABLE to sell, with a net P&L of $-0.26, which is well below the 2% stop-loss threshold. As per the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, an unprofitable position cannot be sold unless it triggers a stop-loss.

According to mandatory fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position must be held unless a stop-loss is hit. Technical analysis for a new trade shows a conflicted market: short-term trend indicators (MACD, price below SMAs) are bearish, but momentum oscillators (Williams %R, Stochastic K) are deeply oversold, suggesting a potential bounce. The AI trend analysis is bearish with low confidence, indicating high uncertainty. Extremely high volume with flat price adds to the ambiguity.

From a technical perspective on the 5-minute timeframe (1-hour data unavailable), the price is trading above its 20 and 50 SMAs, and a significant volume of 5,000,000 with a 5,000,000.00x average volume ratio indicates strong market interest coinciding with a positive daily change of +0.37%.

The current price ($107807.83) is robustly trading above both the SMA 20 ($107764.71) and SMA 50 ($107771.18), signaling a clear uptrend. MACD Histogram is positive (2.504) and the MACD line is above its signal line, confirming strong bullish momentum. Both Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are in very strong buying territory, indicative of significant buying pressure and market enthusiasm. Critically, the current volume (78,012,222) is an astounding 31,497,908.21x the average, providing overwhelming confirmation and conviction for the bullish price action. The AI Trend Analysis also confidently identifies a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. As an aggressive trader, we are actively maximizing profit through decisive action and accepting higher risk for higher potential returns. While the existing small position is currently unprofitable to sell (net P&L: $-0.01 after fees), this strong, confirmed bullish signal warrants adding to the position to capitalize on the powerful momentum and maximize potential gains, rather than missing out on further upside. The current unprofitable position will be held as we add new shares.",

This is further supported by the current price ($2482.92) maintaining above both the 20-period ($2481.93) and 50-period ($2482.08) Simple Moving Averages, suggesting short-term upward strength. While the MACD exhibits a bearish signal (histogram below zero and MACD line below signal line), the overwhelming volume and price action above key moving averages counterbalance this, particularly under an aggressive strategy that prioritizes momentum. The existing position is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L: $-0.26), making a BUY action strategically aligned to potentially capitalize on the indicated momentum or average down the position.

Technical analysis shows conflicting short-term signals: momentum indicators (Williams %R -96.1, Stochastic K 3.9) are deeply oversold, which are strong crypto buy signals according to the trading rules, suggesting a potential for a bounce and price recovery. However, the MACD shows a minor bearish crossover and the price is slightly below SMAs, all within an extremely flat market (0.00% daily change, NEUTRAL AI trend with LOW confidence). The extremely high volume ratio indicates significant market activity which could precede a move. Given the aggressive mode's emphasis on momentum and the mandate to hold unprofitable positions, maintaining the position to capitalize on a potential rebound from oversold conditions is the only permissible and strategically sound action.",

Key momentum indicators like MACD, Williams %R, and Stochastic K are displaying zero or NaN values, rendering them unreliable. RSI is neutral at 50.0.

MACD Histogram is positive (2.504) and the MACD line is above its signal line, confirming strong bullish momentum. Both Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are in very strong buying territory, indicative of significant buying pressure and market enthusiasm. Critically, the current volume (78,012,222) is an astounding 31,497,908.21x the average, providing overwhelming confirmation and conviction for the bullish price action. The AI Trend Analysis also confidently identifies a BULLISH trend with HIGH confidence. As an aggressive trader, we are actively maximizing profit through decisive action and accepting higher risk for higher potential returns. While the existing small position is currently unprofitable to sell (net P&L: $-0.01 after fees), this strong, confirmed bullish signal warrants adding to the position to capitalize on the powerful momentum and maximize potential gains, rather than missing out on further upside. The current unprofitable position will be held as we add new shares.",

This signals a high risk of a short-term reversal or significant pullback. The AI trend analysis also identifies a BULLISH trend but with LOW confidence and HIGH risk due to these overbought conditions. Given the aggressive trading mode, entering a new BUY under these mixed technicals with strong overbought warnings and no 1-hour data for broader trend confirmation is not advisable, and selling the existing unprofitable position is prohibited by the rules.",

According to critical fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position that is not at a stop-loss trigger MUST be held. Technically, the 5-minute timeframe presents a bearish leaning. Price ($2480.44) is trading below bearishly crossed moving averages (SMA20 $2482.18 < SMA50 $2482.23), and momentum oscillators such as Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are nearing overbought levels, indicating potential for a downward reversal. The AI Trend Analysis also reports a BEARISH trend with medium confidence, further supported by significant negative price movement amplified by extremely high volume (716852.08x average). While the MACD shows a bullish crossover, it is contradicted by stronger, more immediate bearish signals from SMAs and momentum oscillators. Given these factors, a new BUY is not justified (technical score below 4+), and a SELL is prohibited for the existing unprofitable position.",

Crucially, volume is exceptionally high (34208.58x average), signifying strong buying interest and confirmation of the bullish trend, which is a key priority in aggressive trading. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this with a HIGH confidence BULLISH outlook, attributing the oversold momentum indicators (Williams %R -96.1, Stochastic K 3.9) as supporting a strong upward bias (potential for a bounce from a short-term dip within an uptrend). Despite missing 1-hour data, the overwhelming strength in the 5-minute timeframe, especially the extreme volume and clear price/MACD alignment, warrants an aggressive BUY.

Per mandatory fee-aware sell rules, we MUST recommend HOLD for this position as it is not a 2%+ stop-loss trigger. For potential new trades, the technical analysis is significantly hampered by unreliable underlying data. While the price shows a slight positive daily change (+0.37%) and is above the 5-minute SMAs, key momentum and volatility indicators are either neutral (RSI 50.0, MACD at 0.000) or outright unreliable/missing (Williams %R, Stochastic K are 'nan', ATR is 0.000 despite price movement, Volume MA is 0 making Volume Ratio misleading). The AI trend analysis confirms a 'BULLISH' trend but with 'LOW' confidence and 'HIGH' risk, explicitly stating \"unreliable underlying data for several key indicators introduce significant uncertainty.\" Given these data integrity issues, even with a calculated technical score that might otherwise suggest a buy, the lack of reliable signals prevents a confident entry or adding to the position. Aggressive mode requires decisive action on strong signals, but unreliable data constitutes a fundamental lack of clear signals. Therefore, the overall recommendation is to HOLD until clearer and more reliable market data emerges to form an actionable trading signal.",

As per critical fee-aware sell rule #4, the existing position MUST be held unless a stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here. For new trading opportunities, the technical signals on the 5-minute timeframe are conflicting. Price is currently above both the SMA 20 ($107764.71) and SMA 50 ($107771.18), with a positive daily change of +0.10%, which are bullish short-term indicators. Furthermore, the Current Volume is exceptionally high at 78,096,352, with a Volume Ratio of 31461203.63x average, indicating significant market activity. However, the MACD Histogram (-10.226) and MACD Line are below the Signal Line, indicating bearish momentum. Oscillators like RSI (50.0), Williams %R (-40.0), and Stochastic K (60.0) are all in neutral territory. The AI trend analysis explicitly states a 'NEUTRAL' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence and 'HIGH' risk, directly citing these \"conflicting signals and a lack of clear direction.\" Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of any sustained medium-term trend and reduces overall confidence, as per the dual timeframe instruction to weight 1-hour trends more heavily. Given the aggressive trading mode prioritizes momentum and volume, the conflict between high volume (suggesting potential movement) and bearish MACD (suggesting downward momentum) combined with neutral oscillators and AI's neutral trend means there is no sufficiently strong and confirmed directional signal (neither 4+ for BUY nor 6- for SELL) to justify initiating a new aggressive trade at this time. Therefore, the recommendation is to HOLD the existing position and await clearer directional signals before considering new entries.",

Supporting this, the AI Trend Analysis indicates a NEUTRAL trend with HIGH confidence due to an extremely flat market (0.00% daily change, zero ADX). While the 5-minute MACD shows a bullish crossover and current volume is exceptionally high (708055.89x average), these are contradicted by the price trading below both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, and both Stochastic K (80.0) and Williams %R (-20.0) indicating overbought conditions.

Critically, in this AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, the current volume is extraordinarily high with a Volume Ratio of 31556224.57x average, signaling significant momentum and market interest, which is a primary driver for a BUY decision. While the MACD shows a strong bearish cross with a negative histogram (MACD Line -13.215, Signal -2.774), presenting a conflicting signal and inherent risk, the dominant momentum and bullish price action above key moving averages warrant a BUY. The existing position of 0.00649492 shares is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L After Fees: -$0.008), therefore, per mandatory rules, this specific position must be HELD. This BUY recommendation is for initiating a new trade to capitalize on the identified bullish momentum.",

The AI Trend Analysis indicates a 'BEARISH' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence, citing the price trading below key moving averages and negative daily change, suggesting underlying selling pressure. This is reinforced by the current price of $2480.44 being below both SMA 20 ($2482.05) and SMA 50 ($2482.28). However, short-term momentum indicators like MACD Histogram (0.161), Williams %R (-20.1), and Stochastic K (79.9) all suggest recent upward momentum or are nearing overbought levels, indicating short-term buying pressure or a potential bounce. Volume is exceptionally high (715134.75x average), confirming significant market activity, though its overall directional impact is ambiguous given the conflicting signals. With no 1-hour data available and no news sentiment, the decision is primarily driven by the mandatory rule to hold unprofitable positions that are not at an emergency stop-loss, while acknowledging the conflicting technical forces at play.",

Moving Averages (SMA 20 at $120.37 above SMA 50 at $120.36) show bullish alignment. Momentum indicators like Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are deeply oversold, which, according to crypto-adjusted risk management, are strong BUY signals suggesting a potential bullish reversal or breakout. Critically, the current volume is exceptionally high (34142.89x average), indicating strong market interest and supporting an imminent upward price movement, which aligns with the aggressive mode's prioritization of momentum and volume. The AI Trend Analysis also confirms a BULLISH outlook with MEDIUM confidence. While the MACD shows a slight bearish crossover, its values are near zero, indicating weak momentum and is significantly outweighed by the other strong bullish indicators. Given the aggressive trading mode's objective to maximize profit and the robust bullish signals, holding the profitable position is recommended to capitalize on the anticipated upside. A BUY action is not possible due to the \"Max shares per stock: 5\" constraint, as 5.4015 shares are currently held.",

As per CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULE #4, a HOLD recommendation is mandatory for positions that are \"\u274c UNPROFITABLE to sell\" and not triggering a stop-loss. From a technical analysis perspective, the 5-minute timeframe shows the current price ($577.66) is above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50 ($575.53), indicating a short-term bullish bias. Momentum is strong, highlighted by the exceptionally high current volume (5,000,000) and volume ratio (5000000.00x average), which aligns with the aggressive trading mode's prioritization of momentum indicators. The AI Trend Analysis confirms a BULLISH trend with Medium Confidence, reasoning that price is above key moving averages supported by strong volume. However, the AI also notes an overbought condition, and other indicators like RSI (50.0) and MACD (neutral) are not strongly bullish. The absence of 1-hour data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe assessment. Despite the underlying bullish momentum, the position must be held to await a price increase that yields a net profitable exit.",

Critically, in this AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, the current volume is extraordinarily high with a Volume Ratio of 31556224.57x average, signaling significant momentum and market interest, which is a primary driver for a BUY decision. While the MACD shows a strong bearish cross with a negative histogram (MACD Line -13.215, Signal -2.774), presenting a conflicting signal and inherent risk, the dominant momentum and bullish price action above key moving averages warrant a BUY. The existing position of 0.00649492 shares is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L After Fees: -$0.008), therefore, per mandatory rules, this specific position must be HELD.

For new potential trades, the technical signals are conflicting. Price is currently trading above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating weak short-term bullishness, and this is supported by extremely high volume, which signifies strong market activity. However, the MACD shows a clear bearish crossover, a reliable and strong bearish signal for crypto markets. Other momentum indicators like RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic are perfectly neutral. The AI trend analysis confirms this mixed picture, identifying a \"BULLISH\" trend but with \"LOW confidence\" and \"HIGH risk\" due to \"significant conflicting signals, warranting caution.\" While the aggressive trading mode encourages decisive action, the lack of clear directional conviction, coupled with strong conflicting momentum indicators and the AI's cautionary stance, dictates a HOLD.

Despite the aggressive trading mode, realizing a loss without a specific stop-loss condition is explicitly prohibited. Technical analysis shows mixed signals on the 5-minute timeframe: price is below bearishly aligned SMA 20 and SMA 50, and the AI trend analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with medium confidence, supported by high volume interpreted as selling pressure. However, momentum indicators like MACD Histogram (positive) and Stochastic K (79.9, near overbought) show some short-term bullish momentum. Given the absence of 1-hour timeframe data, a critical component for trend confirmation, and the conflicting short-term signals, there is no strong actionable BUY signal (Technical score not 4+). A SELL is not viable due to unprofitability. Therefore, the prudent action, adhering to the mandatory profitability rules, is to HOLD the existing position and await either a recovery to profitability or a clear stop-loss trigger.",

Critically, Williams %R and Stochastic K are deeply oversold, which, combined with the extremely high volume (34166x average) and the AI's HIGH confidence BULLISH trend prediction for a \"strong upward bounce,\" indicates a high probability of an imminent price surge. Holding this profitable position aligns with the aggressive trading mode's objective to maximize profit by riding the anticipated bullish continuation.

Gross P&L is $-0.00, meaning no 2%+ loss has occurred. While the AI trend analysis indicates BULLISH sentiment with MEDIUM confidence, the underlying 5-minute technical indicators are largely neutral or conflicting. RSI is 50.0 (neutral), MACD Histogram, Line, and Signal are all 0.000 (indicating no clear momentum). While current volume is high at 5,000,000, the Volume MA, ATR, and 20-day Volatility are all 0.000, which suggests data inconsistencies and reduces confidence in sustained momentum or price movement. The lack of 1-hour data prevents comprehensive dual timeframe analysis for stronger trend confirmation. Given the ambiguity in technical signals and the mandatory unprofitable sell rule, the optimal action for the existing position is to HOLD and await clearer signals or a profitable exit point. New BUY action is not warranted as the aggregate technical score does not meet the \"4+\" aggressive BUY threshold.",

For BTCUSD, the current price is trading above both the SMA 20 ($107791.66) and SMA 50 ($107777.64), indicating a bullish short-term trend. The daily change is positive (+0.10%). Critically, current volume is exceptionally high at 78,118,322, showing strong buying interest and momentum. The Volume Ratio of 31446646.57x further confirms this aggressive influx. While the MACD histogram is negative (-3.684) and MACD line is below its signal, indicating short-term bearish divergence, the overall AI trend analysis still identifies a BULLISH trend with medium confidence, explicitly noting \"positive daily change and reported high volume with positive price movement.\" The RSI is at a healthy 57.1, suggesting room for further upward movement without being overbought. Given the strong volume and price action above key moving averages, the technical score exceeds the aggressive mode's BUY threshold (4+). The existing position is unprofitable to sell, so a BUY is an addition to capture perceived upward momentum.",

The RSI (40.0) and Williams %R (-40.1) also lean bearish, reinforcing the overall downtrend. The AI Trend analysis explicitly states a BEARISH trend with HIGH confidence, driven by these technical configurations. While aggressive trading mode would typically trigger a SELL action given the strong bearish signals (technical score 2 is well within the 6- range for selling), the current position of 0.402653 shares is unprofitable (Net P&L: $-1.26) and not experiencing a 2%+ loss to trigger a stop-loss. According to CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES (Rule #4), it is mandatory to HOLD an unprofitable position unless it meets the stop-loss criteria.

While the AI trend analysis indicates a strong bullish trend with high confidence, supported by price above key moving averages ($120.42 > SMA 20:$120.37, SMA 50:$120.36), a positive MACD crossover (MACD Line 0.005 > Signal 0.003), and exceptionally high volume (33895x average), short-term momentum indicators like Williams %R (-0.0) and Stochastic K (100.0) are showing extreme overbought conditions. Given that the portfolio currently holds more than the maximum allowed shares for this stock (5.4015 > 5 shares), preventing further buying, and the aggressive trading mode prioritizes maximizing profit through decisive action and quick exits on technical signals, taking profit now is prudent. This move capitalizes on the current price strength before a potential short-term pullback or consolidation, which is often indicated by such overbought signals, especially in the absence of confirming 1-hour timeframe data for sustained medium-term strength. The technical score of 4.5, while reflecting a bullish trend, falls within the \"6-\" actionable range for SELL, particularly when combined with extreme overbought short-term conditions and current profitability.",

As per critical sell rules, a HOLD is mandatory under these conditions. Despite the \"AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE\" and the AI's \"BULLISH\" trend assessment, the overall technical picture presents significant contradictions and a lack of strong, clear signals required for a decisive BUY or SELL action. Key momentum indicators like MACD and RSI are neutral/flat (0.000 and 50.0 respectively). While current volume is exceptionally high (5,000,000), this is critically contradicted by zero ATR and 20-day volatility (0.000), indicating a lack of actual price movement despite high activity. The AI's reasoning itself highlights \"weak bullish momentum,\" \"low Confidence,\" \"HIGH Risk,\" \"lack of strong trend confirmation,\" \"numerous flat/zero indicators,\" and even an \"overbought Bollinger Band signal,\" which is a bearish indicator. Furthermore, the absence of 1-hour data prevents medium-term trend confirmation, which is crucial for higher confidence. The conflicting and weak technical signals, coupled with the unprofitable current position, mandate a HOLD to await clearer market direction or a profitable exit opportunity.",

Momentum indicators Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are deeply oversold, which, under crypto-adjusted risk management, are strong signals for a potential bullish reversal. An exceptionally high volume ratio (33992.32x average) confirms significant market interest and potential for a decisive move. The AI Trend Analysis also identifies a \"WEAK_BULLISH\" trend with medium confidence, primarily due to these oversold conditions. While MACD shows a slight bearish crossover, the overwhelming bullish strength from oversold oscillators and massive volume outweighs this. Given the aggressive trading mode to maximize profit and accept higher risk for potential returns, holding this profitable position, which exhibits strong BUY signals (Technical Score 9), is the optimal strategy. The \"Max shares per stock: 5\" constraint is noted; however, as the technicals are strongly bullish and the position is profitable, the constraint is interpreted as preventing further buys rather than forcing a sell of a profitable, technically bullish, existing overweight position.",

This is supported by the 5-minute technical indicators: the current price ($107700.02) is trading below both the SMA 20 ($107786.27) and SMA 50 ($107775.49), a clear bearish signal. Furthermore, a bearish MACD crossover is evident (MACD Line 6.171 < MACD Signal 7.926) with a negative MACD Histogram (-1.756), confirming downward momentum. The daily price change is also negative (-0.10%), and current volume is extremely high (78,118,328, 31517236.16x average), which tends to confirm the prevailing trend, which is bearish. Despite these strong bearish technical signals, the current BTCUSD position is UNPROFITABLE (Net P&L After Fees: $-0.76) and does not meet the 2%+ stop-loss trigger. Therefore, adhering strictly to the critical fee-aware sell rules, the position MUST be HELD to avoid realizing a loss, as selling an unprofitable position is prohibited outside of stop-loss conditions.

The 5-minute technical indicators reinforce this bearish sentiment: the current price ($2480.44) is below both the SMA 20 ($2482.30) and SMA 50 ($2482.38), and the MACD line is below its signal line with a negative histogram. The extremely high Volume Ratio (719461.53x average) alongside the significant current volume (77,659,347) further confirms strong bearish momentum.

The current price ($120.42) is trading above both the SMA 20 ($120.36) and SMA 50 ($120.36), further confirming an upward short-term trend. Critically, the current volume is extremely high (34172.89x average), which provides strong confirmation for the bullish move and sustained buying interest, a key factor for aggressive trading. While Williams %R (-0.0) and Stochastic K (100.0) indicate overbought conditions, the overall technical strength, combined with the AI's explicit reasoning acknowledging these conditions but still confirming a strong upward momentum, suggests that in an aggressive, crypto-adjusted trading context, the trend is likely to persist. My current position is profitable (Net P&L: +$0.12), and the technical score of 7 (above the 6- SELL threshold) does not trigger a sell. Given the directives to maximize profit and accept higher risk with strong momentum, holding this profitable position aligns best with the aggressive strategy, allowing for potential further upside. I am currently over the maximum shares per stock limit (5.4015 shares vs. max 5), which prevents any additional BUY orders.",

Therefore, a HOLD is required for the existing position. For any new trading action, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which is critical for establishing a strong directional trend as per the instruction to \"Weight 1-hour trends MORE heavily than 5-minute for direction.\" While current 5-minute volume is extremely high (5,000,000, 5000000.00x average), indicating strong market activity, the MACD and RSI are neutral (0.000 and 50.0 respectively), and price action shows only a modest daily change of +0.37%. The AI trend analysis is 'BULLISH' with 'MEDIUM' confidence, but explicitly warns of a \"potential for a short-term pullback,\" despite its reference to \"positive MACD signals\" which contradicts the provided neutral MACD data. Given the lack of reliable 1-hour trend confirmation and the AI's warning of a potential pullback, initiating a new BUY order carries undue risk for an aggressive strategy aiming to maximize profit quickly. A HOLD is the most prudent action to avoid entering into a potential downturn and to await clearer, fully confirmed directional signals.",

Per mandatory trading rules, an unprofitable position must be HELD unless a stop-loss is triggered. For new trades, the 5-minute technical analysis presents mixed signals: MACD is bullish (Histogram 1.944, Line above Signal), but price is below both the 20 and 50 period SMAs (bearish). All key momentum oscillators (RSI, Williams %R, Stochastic K) are at neutral midpoints (50.0). The AI Trend Analysis explicitly states \"NEUTRAL\" trend with \"LOW Confidence\" and \"HIGH Risk,\" further indicating indecision. While current volume is extremely high (31M x average), it does not provide clear directional conviction given the mixed price action. Critically, no 1-hour timeframe data is available, preventing a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and trend confirmation, which is essential for higher-confidence trades in aggressive mode. Without a clear directional signal and with high risk flagged by the AI, an aggressive HOLD is the decisive action to avoid unnecessary risk and preserve capital, adhering to both the mandatory profitability rules and strategic trading principles.",

Technical analysis presents a mixed picture, preventing a strong BUY signal. While MACD shows a bullish cross and positive histogram, indicating some short-term upward momentum, price is trading below key moving averages (SMA20 < SMA50, a bearish crossover), and the AI trend analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with medium confidence, citing high volume on a negative price day and negative OBV. Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are high, nearing overbought conditions which could signal caution. With no news to provide a strong sentiment boost, and conflicting technical signals, initiating a new trade (BUY or SELL) is not advisable under the aggressive trading mode which prioritizes clear momentum. Therefore, holding the current position is the appropriate action while awaiting clearer directional signals or price recovery.",

The current price of $577.66 trading above both SMA 20 ($575.53) and SMA 50 ($575.53) further confirms a short-term uptrend.

Key momentum oscillators (RSI, Williams %R, Stochastic K) are perfectly neutral at 50. The AI trend analysis indicates NEUTRAL with LOW CONFIDENCE.

Technical indicators on the 5-minute timeframe show strong bearish signals, including a bearish MACD crossover (MACD Line -0.128, Signal -0.073), SMA20 ($2482.18) below SMA50 ($2482.38), and an AI Trend analysis confirming a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence. While Stochastic K (79.9) is nearing overbought conditions and Williams %R (-20.1) is approaching oversold, these are not strong enough to override the bearish momentum indicated by MACD and SMAs. The extremely high volume (705343.13x average) suggests significant underlying activity and potential for a sharp move, which, combined with the bearish technicals, leans towards further downside. However, the existing position is not at a profitable exit point nor has it hit the stop-loss, necessitating a HOLD.",

Despite the absence of 1-hour timeframe data, the 5-minute analysis shows strong bullish reversal signals: Williams %R is at -100.0 and Stochastic K is at 0.0, both indicating extremely oversold conditions, which often precede a sharp upward bounce in crypto markets. The price ($120.42) is holding above both the SMA 20 ($120.36) and SMA 50 ($120.36), further supporting a bullish outlook. Crucially, the current volume (32,442,938) is an astounding 34249.20x the average, signaling a massive surge in interest and potential for significant price movement. While the MACD indicates a bearish crossover near zero, this is outweighed by the extreme oversold conditions, strong volume, and price action above key moving averages. The AI Trend Analysis also indicates BULLISH momentum with MEDIUM confidence based on these factors. Given that the current shares (4.986) are at maximum capacity (5 shares), a BUY action is not possible. Holding this profitable position to capitalize on the anticipated bounce from these strong bullish technicals aligns with the aggressive strategy to maximize potential returns.",

While the 5-minute timeframe exhibits some bullish indicators such as the current price trading above SMA 20 and SMA 50, a positive daily change (+0.37%), and extremely high current volume (5,000,000 with a 5000000.00x average ratio), the AI trend analysis provides critical caveats. The AI identifies a BULLISH trend but with LOW confidence and HIGH risk, specifically stating the asset is \"significantly overbought according to Bollinger Bands\" and noting uncertainty due to a \"lack of historical volatility data.\" Despite the aggressive trading mode and a calculated technical score of 4 being actionable for BUY, the mandatory HOLD on the existing unprofitable position combined with the AI's explicit warnings regarding overbought conditions, low confidence, and high risk makes it prudent to not add to the position at this time.

While the existing position is currently unprofitable (Net P&L: $-0.76) and therefore must be held according to the critical fee-aware sell rules, the current technical signals for BTCUSD warrant a new BUY entry. The 5-minute timeframe shows a strong bullish MACD crossover with a positive histogram (MACD Line: 13.191 > MACD Signal: 7.323), which is a more reliable indicator in crypto's trending markets. Crucially, the Volume Ratio is an astounding 31,321,090.22x average, indicating exceptionally high market interest and potential for a significant price move, which aligns perfectly with our momentum-driven strategy. While the price is slightly below short-term SMAs and the daily change is negative (-0.20%), and the AI analysis notes conflicting signals with low confidence, these are outweighed by the prioritized strong bullish momentum and extreme volume. Neutral RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic K indicators suggest the market is poised, rather than committed to a bearish trend, allowing momentum to take over.

This is despite strong bearish technical signals from the 5-minute timeframe analysis, which indicates price trading below key moving averages (SMA 20/50), a confirmed bearish MACD cross with a negative histogram, and high volume (711416x average) reinforcing the negative price movement. The AI trend analysis also confirms a 'BEARISH' trend with HIGH confidence.

The 5-minute timeframe data shows strong bullish signals: current price ($120.42) is above both SMA 20 ($120.36) and SMA 50 ($120.36), and a bullish MACD crossover is evident with a positive MACD histogram. Critically, volume is exceptionally high (34204.53x average), providing strong confirmation for the bullish momentum. Momentum oscillators Williams %R (-96.1) and Stochastic K (3.9) are deeply oversold, which, in a crypto bullish trend, often signals a potential upward bounce or continuation of the upward movement, aligning with the AI's reasoning of \"imminent upward movement.\" The AI trend analysis explicitly states \"BULLISH\" with \"HIGH\" confidence and \"LOW\" risk. Although 1-hour data is unavailable, the 5-minute technicals combined with the AI's high confidence and massive volume indicate a strong likelihood of further price appreciation. Given the current position is profitable and at the maximum allowed shares (4.986 out of 5), the most aggressive and profit-maximizing action is to HOLD the position to capture further gains in the confirmed bullish trend, rather than selling prematurely.",

Per mandatory trading rules, a sell action is not permissible unless a 2%+ stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here. While the 5-minute timeframe indicates a BULLISH trend according to AI analysis, it is accompanied by LOW confidence and a HIGH risk level. The AI also highlights an overbought condition with potential for reversal. Key indicators such as RSI (50.0) and MACD (0.000) are neutral, failing to provide strong directional signals for either buying or selling. Although current volume is extremely high, suggesting momentum, this is counteracted by the 'overbought' warning. No 1-hour data is available for broader trend confirmation. Therefore, the most prudent action is to HOLD the current position, awaiting either a return to profitability for an exit or a clear, strong technical signal for a new entry/exit.",

Technically, the 5-minute timeframe presents conflicting signals: a bullish MACD crossover (MACD Line 8.726 > MACD Signal 4.743) suggests upward momentum, but the current price ($107700.02) is below both the SMA 20 ($107775.49) and SMA 50 ($107764.71), indicating short-term weakness relative to moving averages. The daily change is slightly negative (-0.10%), and the extremely high volume (Volume Ratio: 31344525.15x average) on a negative price change is interpreted by the AI as significant selling pressure. RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic K are all neutral around 50. The lack of 1-hour timeframe data prevents medium-term trend confirmation, which is a critical component for aggressive trading decisions. The AI trend analysis also identifies the trend as NEUTRAL with MEDIUM confidence due to these conflicting signals. With no strong technical bias for a new buy, and an explicit prohibition on selling at a loss, HOLD is the only viable recommendation.",

As per the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES (MANDATORY), specifically rule #4, the recommendation MUST be HOLD until the position becomes profitable or an emergency stop-loss is triggered. Despite this mandatory HOLD, a deeper technical analysis for potential future action reveals conflicting signals. The AI Trend Analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with Medium Confidence, and the price is currently below key short-term moving averages. However, strong bullish momentum indicators (RSI at 55.6, a bullish MACD crossover with positive histogram, Williams %R at -20.1, and Stochastic K at 79.9) are present on the 5-minute timeframe. The AI's reasoning itself notes that \"momentum indicators... show bullish signals, suggesting the bearish pressure is weak and a short-term rebound is possible.\" This short-term bullish momentum, coupled with extremely high volume (712356.88x average), suggests potential for recovery or a short-term bounce, which could help the existing unprofitable position move towards profitability.

The technical analysis for the 5-minute timeframe presents mixed signals. While the MACD shows a bullish crossover (MACD Line > Signal Line), indicating potential upward momentum, the price is currently trading below both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, and has a negative daily change (-0.10%). Key momentum indicators like RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic K are perfectly neutral at 50, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. Volume is exceptionally high, which can fuel a move in either direction. The AI's trend analysis confirms a NEUTRAL trend with MEDIUM confidence due to these conflicting signals and current consolidation. Crucially, 1-hour data for medium-term trend confirmation is unavailable, which significantly reduces the confidence for a decisive BUY or SELL action, especially given the instruction to weight 1-hour trends more heavily. With no strong bullish conviction (technical score not 4+), a constrained sell rule, and a neutral overall trend, holding the current position is the most prudent action.",

This is further supported by a bullish MACD crossover (MACD Line 0.003 > MACD Signal 0.000) and an exceptionally high volume spike (34245.11x average), indicating significant buying interest and confirming the AI's HIGH confidence BULLISH trend prediction. While these are strong signals for a BUY, the portfolio constraints prevent further action. We are currently holding 4.98629 shares, which is at the maximum limit of 5 shares per stock, thus preventing any new BUY orders. Furthermore, the existing position is currently unprofitable (Net P&L: $-0.48), and according to mandatory fee-aware sell rules, we are prohibited from selling at a loss unless a 2%+ stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here (current loss is only 0.083%). Therefore, the only permissible action is to HOLD the current position, anticipating the indicated bullish reversal to move the position into profitability.",

Per mandatory fee-aware sell rule #4, an unprofitable position must be HELD until it becomes profitable or reaches a stop-loss. However, the market technicals are strongly bearish. Price is trading below both the 20-period ($107770.10) and 50-period ($107762.55) Simple Moving Averages. The MACD shows a strong bearish crossover with a negative histogram (-5.629), indicating downward momentum. Current volume is extremely high (78,132,010), representing a 31312065.10x average, which confirms strong bearish price action. The AI Trend Analysis is \"BEARISH\" with \"MEDIUM\" confidence. While indicators like Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) suggest oversold conditions and a potential short-term bounce, the dominant trend and momentum indicators are unequivocally bearish. Given the aggressive trading mode, this would typically be a strong SELL signal, but the mandatory profitability rule for the existing position overrides immediate action. The HIGH priority reflects the need to closely monitor for a profitable exit opportunity or a stop-loss trigger given the strong bearish outlook.",

For overall market conditions, while the 5-minute timeframe exhibits upward momentum with exceptionally high current volume (5,000,000x average) and the price trading above both SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating short-term bullishness, there are significant mitigating factors. The AI trend analysis, despite being bullish with medium confidence, explicitly warns of an \"overbought condition indicated by the price being above the upper Bollinger Band [suggesting] a potential short-term retracement.\" Furthermore, both RSI (50.0) and MACD (0.000) are neutral, not providing strong confirmation. Critically, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents medium-term trend confirmation, a factor weighted more heavily for overall direction. Given the \"Aggressive Trading Mode,\" buying into a potentially overbought short-term rally without medium-term confirmation carries high risk of a retracement, which conflicts with maximizing profit through decisive action. Therefore, holding the existing position and refraining from new aggressive entries is the most prudent action to avoid potential losses from a pullback.",

According to critical fee-aware sell rules, I *MUST* recommend HOLD in this scenario. Furthermore, the market for BTCUSD is extremely flat with a 0.00% daily change and the AI trend analysis correctly identifies a \"NEUTRAL\" trend with \"MEDIUM\" confidence due to a complete lack of price movement. While MACD shows a weak bullish signal (line above signal, positive histogram), this is occurring in a static market without supporting price action. RSI, Stochastic K, and Williams %R are all neutral. Despite an exceptionally high volume ratio relative to its MA, this activity has not translated into any price movement, indicating a lack of clear directional momentum for an aggressive new trade. No news data is available to sway the decision. Given the \"UNPROFITABLE to sell\" status and the absence of any strong directional technical signals, holding the current position is the only logical and rule-compliant action.",

Technical indicators present a mixed outlook for short-term direction: Price is below bearishly aligned short-term moving averages and MACD shows slight negative momentum, indicating a bearish bias. However, momentum oscillators (Williams %R and Stochastic K) are at extremely oversold levels (-100.0 and 0.0 respectively), which strongly suggests a potential bounce or reversal, particularly in crypto markets. This is further complicated by an exceptionally high volume ratio (34029.33x average), indicating significant market activity that could precede a decisive move. The AI trend analysis notes a BEARISH trend but with LOW confidence, specifically mentioning a bounce is possible due to oversold indicators. Given the conflicting signals, the inability to sell the existing position profitably, and already holding near the maximum share limit, the most prudent action is to HOLD and await a clearer directional signal or price recovery.",

For new entries, while the 5-minute timeframe shows the price above SMAs and a positive daily change (+0.37%), and current volume is high (5,000,000), momentum indicators (RSI 50, MACD 0.000) are neutral. Crucially, the AI analysis indicates overbought conditions (price above the upper Bollinger Band) with a potential for a short-term correction. The absence of 1-hour data prevents robust medium-term trend confirmation, which is a significant limitation for making high-confidence directional trades. Despite the aggressive trading mode prioritizing momentum and volume for profit maximization, the conflicting signals, particularly the overbought warning and neutral short-term momentum, make buying more at this level too risky. Therefore, maintaining the existing position while awaiting clearer directional signals or price recovery to a profitable selling point is the most prudent action.",

Technically, the 5-minute timeframe presents mixed signals with a neutral overall trend. While MACD shows a bullish signal (MACD Line > Signal Line), momentum oscillators (RSI, Stochastic, Williams %R) are perfectly neutral at 50.0. Crucially, the current price ($107700.02) is below both the 5-minute SMA 20 ($107775.49) and SMA 50 ($107762.55), indicating short-term bearish pressure. The AI trend analysis confirms a NEUTRAL trend with MEDIUM confidence, highlighting that \"price remains below key moving averages, and bearish pressure is confirmed by high volume on negative price movement\". The extremely high volume (31179514.63x average) is associated with this negative price action, further dampening bullish prospects. Given the lack of 1-hour data for medium-term trend confirmation, the current technical setup does not provide a strong enough BUY signal (technical score < 4) nor does it trigger a stop-loss for the existing position. Therefore, the most prudent action is to HOLD the existing shares and await clearer directional cues or price recovery.",

As per the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, an unprofitable position that is not at its stop-loss trigger must be held. The underlying technical analysis, if considering new trades, points to a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence (AI analysis), supported by the current price ($2480.44) trading below both the SMA 20 ($2482.43) and SMA 50 ($2482.33). Furthermore, the AI reasoning highlights high volume on negative price movement and a negative OBV, indicating prevailing selling pressure. Despite a weak bullish MACD crossover, the overall momentum and price action suggest short-term weakness, making new BUY entries unadvisable and a SELL preferable if not for the current position's unprofitability. No news sentiment data is available to influence the decision.",

A massive volume spike (33747.48x average) suggests significant activity, but the immediate momentum indicators point to downside.

For new actions, the technical signals are mixed. While the price is above key moving averages (SMA 20 & 50) and daily change is positive, the MACD is neutral to slightly negative, and the AI trend analysis, despite identifying a BULLISH trend, assigns LOW confidence and HIGH risk. Critically, the AI notes the asset is \"significantly overbought\" with a \"risk of a price correction.\" The absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents crucial medium-term trend confirmation. Given the conflicting signals (short-term price strength vs. overbought/correction risk) and the mandatory fee-aware sell rule, HOLD is the appropriate action.",

Furthermore, the overall technical analysis presents a neutral to slightly conflicting picture, with a bullish MACD crossover countered by the current price trading below both the 20-period and 50-period SMAs, and a negative daily change. While volume is extremely high, indicating activity, the AI trend analysis confirms a 'NEUTRAL' outlook with 'MEDIUM' confidence due to these conflicting signals.

MACD shows a strong bearish crossover with a negative histogram (-0.122) and the MACD line (-0.216) is below its signal line (-0.094). RSI is at 40.0, indicating bearish momentum but not oversold. Volume is exceptionally high (708946.93x average) and accompanying this negative price movement, which strongly confirms the bearish trend.

Despite this, the technical analysis reveals a strong bearish bias: the price is below both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, MACD shows a bearish crossover with a negative histogram, and the AI Trend Analysis confirms a BEARISH outlook with MEDIUM confidence. Critically, an extremely high volume (711691.32x average) is observed without any positive daily price movement (+0.00% daily change), indicating significant selling pressure absorbing all buying interest. While Stochastic K (80.0) and Williams %R (-20.0) suggest overbought conditions that could precede a downward move, the primary driver for the HOLD recommendation is the unprofitability of the existing position, preventing a sell-off at a loss.",

For any new trade, despite a calculated technical score of 4 (meeting the \"actionable for BUY\" threshold), the overall signal quality is poor and contradictory, making it unsuitable for an aggressive BUY action aimed at maximizing profit. While the 5-minute timeframe shows price trading above SMAs ($577.66 > $575.53) and a positive daily change (+0.37%) with high current volume (5,000,000), key momentum indicators (RSI at 50.0 and MACD at 0.000) are neutral, indicating a lack of strong upward thrust. Furthermore, the AI trend analysis, while labelling the trend as 'BULLISH' with 'MEDIUM' confidence, explicitly warns that the asset is 'overbought by Bollinger Bands' and carries a 'HIGH' risk of a 'swift correction.' The complete absence of 1-hour timeframe data is a critical limitation, preventing any medium-term trend confirmation and significantly reducing the reliability of any short-term signals. Given these mixed signals, high-risk warnings, and the lack of strong, confirmed momentum, initiating a new BUY is not advised, even in an aggressive trading mode. It is more prudent to HOLD and await clearer, stronger technical signals.",

Therefore, according to the critical fee-aware sell rules, a mandatory HOLD is required for the existing position. For potential new trades, the comprehensive analysis reveals a STRONG_BEARISH trend with HIGH confidence. This is supported by the current price ($2480.44) being below both the SMA 20 ($2482.67) and SMA 50 ($2482.23), a clear bearish MACD crossover (MACD Line -0.158 below Signal 0.033, Histogram -0.191), and a negative daily change. This bearish momentum is strongly confirmed by exceptionally high volume (Volume Ratio: 706211.09x average). Entering a new long position against such strong bearish momentum and high-confidence AI trend is contrary to the aggressive strategy for maximizing profit, which prioritizes momentum and decisive action in the direction of the trend.",

For potential new trades, the technical signals are highly conflicting. While MACD shows bullish momentum with its positive histogram and line above the signal, this is strongly countered by several bearish indicators. The price is trading below both SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating short-term bearish pressure. Stochastic K (80.0) and Williams %R (-20.0) are in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback. Most critically, the AI trend analysis highlights \"high volume on negative movement\" and \"negative On-Balance Volume (OBV)\", indicating that the significant volume is associated with selling pressure, which is a strong bearish confirmation. The overall AI trend is NEUTRAL with LOW confidence and HIGH risk. Given the lack of 1-hour data for medium-term trend confirmation and the aggressive mode's emphasis on momentum and volume (which are bearishly interpreted by the AI), initiating a new BUY position is not advisable despite the MACD signal. Therefore, the recommendation for BTCUSD is to HOLD the existing position and avoid opening new ones until clearer, bullish signals emerge.",

A clear bearish MACD cross is present with a negative MACD histogram (-0.128) and the MACD line (-0.029) is below its signal line (0.098), signalling strong downward momentum. This bearish movement is further reinforced by an extremely high volume ratio (715990.24x average), indicating significant selling pressure. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, assigning a HIGH confidence BEARISH trend, citing the price below key moving averages, bearish MACD, and negative price movement confirmed by high volume.

Crucially, volume is exceptionally high (33864.45x average), confirming strong upward momentum. While Williams %R (-96.2) and Stochastic K (3.8) are in oversold territory, the AI trend analysis explicitly interprets these as signals for \"strong potential for continued upward momentum\" in this bullish context, aligning with aggressive trading principles to buy/hold into strength. The \"Max shares per stock: 5\" constraint means I cannot initiate a new BUY order as the current position (5.4015 shares) exceeds this limit. Given the strong bullish technicals and the mandate to MAXIMIZE PROFIT in an AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, holding the existing profitable position is the optimal strategy to capitalize on anticipated further gains, rather than selling into strength due to a constraint on new buys.",

The RSI is neutral at 50.0. Critically, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and robust trend confirmation, reducing confidence for aggressive new entries.

Per the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, a position must not be sold at a loss unless it's an emergency stop-loss trigger (2%+ loss). The current price of $107700.02 is above the calculated 2% stop-loss trigger of $105645.04.

The lack of 1-hour data reduces confidence in the medium-term trend, but the confluence of extreme oversold signals with high volume presents a high-potential, high-risk entry for an aggressive trader seeking to maximize profit from an anticipated bounce.

The current price ($120.42) is trading above both the SMA 20 ($120.35) and SMA 50 ($120.36), signaling an uptrend. MACD shows bullish momentum with a positive histogram (0.002) and the MACD line above its signal line. Volume is exceptionally high (33860x average), providing strong confirmation for the bullish price action. While RSI (54.5) is neutral, the AI interprets the oversold Williams %R and Stochastic K indicators, coupled with positive price change, as suggesting a strong potential for continued upward movement. The current position is profitable with a net P&L of +$0.11, making it eligible for a sell. However, in an AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE focused on maximizing profit and accepting higher risk, selling a strongly bullish and profitable position would be counter-productive to potential further gains. Although the current holding of 5.4015 shares slightly exceeds the \"Max shares per stock: 5\" constraint, the overwhelming bullish technical signals and the profitable status justify holding the position to capitalize on the confirmed uptrend. This aligns with the strategy to be quick to enter/exit based on signals (which are currently bullish) and prioritize momentum and volume for maximizing profit.",

Technical analysis for the 5-minute timeframe shows the price above the SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating short-term bullish sentiment, and high current volume is positive. However, the RSI is neutral (50.0), MACD is flat (0.000), and critical 1-hour timeframe data, along with several other key indicators (Williams %R, Stochastic K, ATR, 20-day Volatility, Volume MA), are missing or zero, severely impacting the reliability of the analysis. The AI trend analysis, while stating \"BULLISH,\" has \"LOW\" confidence and \"HIGH\" risk due to these data gaps. No news sentiment is available.

As per mandatory trading rules, selling an unprofitable position that is not at a 2%+ stop-loss is prohibited. The current loss of 0.0193% is well below the stop-loss threshold. For new actions, the 5-minute timeframe shows mixed signals: bullish momentum from MACD (0.542 > 0.335) and price holding above both SMA 20 ($2482.80) and SMA 50 ($2482.33) suggests underlying strength. However, aggressive short-term momentum indicators like Williams %R (-0.2) and Stochastic K (99.8) are extremely overbought, indicating potential for a pullback or consolidation, which aligns with the 0% daily price change and the AI's \"NEUTRAL\" trend assessment with \"limited immediate upside\". The exceptionally high volume ratio (715510.79x average) shows strong market interest but has not translated into price movement, suggesting a stall. The absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents crucial medium-term trend confirmation, further reducing conviction for any aggressive new entry. Given these conflicting signals and the existing unprofitable position, holding is the most prudent strategy to await recovery or clearer directional cues.",

Despite the AI trend being NEUTRAL with LOW confidence, and the 5-minute price showing extreme consolidation with 0% daily change, several key indicators signal potential for an upward bounce. Both Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are at extremely oversold levels, often preceding a reversal upwards, especially in crypto. Critically, current volume is extraordinarily high (34044.17x average), indicating significant market interest and potential for an aggressive move out of consolidation, which aligns with prioritizing momentum and volume in an aggressive trading mode. While MACD shows weak bearish momentum (-0.002 histogram), it is not strong enough to override the powerful oversold signals and massive volume. Holding this profitable position to capture a potential upside bounce from these oversold, high-volume conditions aligns with our aggressive strategy to maximize profit and accept higher risk.",

While the 5-minute timeframe shows some bullish momentum (price above SMAs, positive daily change, and extremely high current volume indicating strong interest), the lack of 1-hour data prevents critical medium-term trend confirmation. The AI trend analysis, despite stating \"BULLISH\", assigns \"LOW Confidence\" and \"HIGH Risk\", and critically warns of an \"overbought condition\" suggesting a \"potential for a pullback\". This contradictory assessment, coupled with anomalous/zero volatility indicators and neutral RSI/MACD readings, significantly reduces the conviction for any aggressive buy action. Given the overall mixed signals, the explicit \"unprofitable to sell\" status of the existing position, and the high risk/low confidence warnings, the prudent action is to HOLD and await clearer, more aligned signals or for the position to become profitable.",

Therefore, as per critical fee-aware sell rules, the current position MUST be held. While a new trade would be considered based purely on technicals, the underlying analysis presents mixed but predominantly bearish signals. The AI Trend Analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence, citing price trading below all short-term moving averages, a bearish SMA crossover, and critically, \"high negative volume\" which is highly prioritized in aggressive mode. This culminates in an overall 'WEAK_BEARISH' technical score from the AI. Despite a bullish MACD crossover, positive MACD histogram, and overbought momentum indicators (Stochastic K at 80.0, Williams %R at -20.0, indicating strong recent upward pressure that may be nearing exhaustion), the overriding bearish trend from price action and the AI's volume interpretation prevents a BUY recommendation.

Technical analysis presents conflicting signals: MACD shows a bearish cross and negative histogram (bearish), while Williams %R and Stochastic K are at extreme oversold levels (potential bullish reversal). However, the price action exhibits extreme flatness (+0.00% daily change) with an AI trend analysis indicating NEUTRAL trend, LOW confidence, and HIGH risk. Despite an extremely high volume ratio (34112.06x average), which signals significant activity and potential for a large move, the lack of directional price movement combined with a bearish MACD and the AI's high-risk assessment suggests caution.

Per the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, I am mandated to recommend HOLD unless there is an emergency stop-loss trigger, which is not present. Furthermore, for considering any new trades (BUY or additional SELL), the technical analysis is severely compromised by missing data, including \"nan\" for Williams %R and Stochastic K, and \"0\" values for MACD Histogram, MACD Line, MACD Signal, Volume MA, ATR, and 20-day Volatility. While the current price ($577.66) is above the SMA 20 ($575.53) and SMA 50 ($575.53), and current volume is high (5,000,000), these bullish indicators are undermined by neutral RSI (50.0) and MACD values (0.000). The AI Trend Analysis indicates BULLISH but with \"LOW Confidence\" and \"HIGH Risk,\" and its reasoning contains contradictions with the raw data (e.g., claiming a bullish MACD signal when raw data shows 0.000). Based on the available data, the technical score is approximately 3.5, which does not meet the \"4+\" threshold for a BUY action in aggressive mode, nor does it meet the \"6-\" threshold for a SELL action. The lack of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a comprehensive dual timeframe analysis.
