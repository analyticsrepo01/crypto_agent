The MACD histogram is positive (0.658) and the MACD line is above its signal line, confirming bullish momentum. A critical factor for this aggressive BUY recommendation is the exceptionally high current volume (78,430,901), which is a staggering 22 million times the average volume, providing strong confirmation and support for the upward price movement. The AI Trend Analysis also confirms a BULLISH trend. While momentum indicators like Williams %R (-4.7) and Stochastic K (95.3) are in overbought territory, in an aggressive crypto trading mode, these often persist during strong trends and are outweighed by the sustained price action, MACD, and overwhelming volume, which signals strong buying interest. Despite the existing position being unprofitable to sell due to fees, the robust bullish technicals support holding the current shares with the expectation of recovery and further appreciation, while simultaneously initiating a new BUY to capitalize on the confirmed upward momentum and maximize potential returns under the aggressive trading directive.
