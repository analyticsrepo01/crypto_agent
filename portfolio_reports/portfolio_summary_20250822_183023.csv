The AI trend analysis, despite being cautiously ""BULLISH"" with ""LOW"" confidence, explicitly notes ""a bearish MACD crossover and negative On-Balance Volume suggest underlying selling pressure and lack of strong conviction."" Volume is extremely high, but if this is due to selling pressure (as suggested by negative OBV), it supports a bearish outlook.

Critically, the current volume is extraordinarily high at 31,921,048, which is 34146.48x the average, indicating massive interest and conviction behind potential moves.
