While 5-minute technicals show mixed signals (MACD is bearish with a negative histogram and a line below its signal, suggesting downward momentum, but the current price is above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, which is typically a short-term bullish trend indicator), the high risk indicated by the AI trend analysis (Bearish, Medium Confidence, High Risk) and the absence of 1-hour data for confirming medium-term trends further support caution.
