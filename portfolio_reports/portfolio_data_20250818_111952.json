      "reasoning": "The current technical analysis for AAPL indicates a consolidating phase with short-term bearish momentum. MACD shows a bearish alignment (Line below Signal, negative Histogram), and the price is currently below the SMA 20, SMA 50, and EMA 26, suggesting underlying weakness. While momentum oscillators like RSI (36.9), Williams %R (-68.0), and Stochastic (D: 25.5) are in the lower range, approaching oversold conditions, they do not yet confirm strong reversal or buy signals required for a balanced trading approach. The AI Trend analysis confirms a NEUTRAL trend with MEDIUM confidence, indicating limited downside or potential for a bounce, but not a clear direction. Volume data is unavailable, preventing crucial confirmation of any price moves. Critically, with an available cash of $111.32 and a minimum cash reserve of $90, only $21.32 is available for trading, which is insufficient to purchase 1 share of AAPL at $231.03. Therefore, no BUY trade can be executed due to funding constraints. We also hold 0 shares, so a SELL is not possible. Given the lack of strong confirming technical signals for a BUY (Technical Score < 6) and the inability to execute a trade due to insufficient funds, the appropriate action is to HOLD.",

      "reasoning": "A BUY action is not possible due to insufficient available cash ($111.32) which is far less than the current share price of $766.20. Furthermore, a SELL action is not possible as there is no current position (0 shares) in META. Even if financial constraints were not an issue, the technical indicators present a mixed and contradictory picture, lacking the \"multiple confirming indicators\" and \"strong technical alignment\" required for a high-priority trade in Balanced Trading Mode. While MACD shows bullish momentum (histogram positive, line above signal), suggesting a potential short-term upward move, longer-term moving averages (SMA 50, EMA 26) indicate the price is below them, suggesting a medium-term downtrend. Crucially, Stochastic is in overbought territory (K=71.4, D=85.0) and shows a bearish cross (K < D), which is a strong counter-signal for a BUY. The AI Trend also indicates NEUTRAL with a \"strong underlying downtrend.\" Without clear, consistent signals and with conflicting momentum and trend indicators, initiating a trade would violate capital preservation principles. No news data is available, so the decision is based solely on technical analysis and financial constraints.",

      "action": "HOLD",

      "reasoning": "The primary reason for a HOLD decision is the insufficient available cash ($111.32) to purchase 1 share of AMZN at its current price of $230.50, while adhering to the minimum cash reserve of $90. A BUY order is therefore not feasible at this time. Furthermore, even if cash were available, a BUY recommendation would be strongly discouraged by multiple technical indicators. AMZN is significantly overbought according to RSI (71.5), Williams %R (-14.1), and both Stochastic K (85.9) and D (90.7), suggesting a high probability of an imminent pullback. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, indicating a \"BEARISH\" trend with \"MEDIUM\" confidence and \"HIGH\" risk due to overbought conditions. While MACD shows a bullish crossover and the price is above key moving averages, these signals are heavily contradicted by the overwhelming overbought momentum, failing the \"demand multiple confirming indicators\" and \"focus on strong technical alignment\" criteria for a BUY in a balanced trading mode. Crucially, volume data is missing, preventing a comprehensive technical assessment. The balanced trading mode prioritizes capital preservation and avoids trades during high volatility or conflicting signals, which is the case for a potential BUY here. The last recorded trade for AMZN was a SELL, further reinforcing a cautious stance.",

Furthermore, while NFLX exhibits strong bullish indicators from moving averages (price above SMA20, SMA50, EMA12, EMA26) and momentum (positive MACD crossover, RSI at 61.5, bullish AI trend), the provided volume data (negative Current Volume, Volume MA, OBV) is highly problematic and contradicts the overall bullish sentiment. This critical lack of confirming volume data, even if cash were available, would prevent a high-priority BUY trade under the 'balanced trading mode' which demands 'multiple confirming indicators' and 'strong technical alignment' while prioritizing capital preservation. No news sentiment is available to provide additional context.",

The AI Trend Analysis confirms a BEARISH trend with HIGH confidence and HIGH risk, reinforcing the dominant downtrend. While momentum indicators such as RSI (23.2), Williams %R (-92.0), and Stochastic (K: 8.0, D: 10.5) show extreme oversold conditions, these do not negate the dominant bearish trend as per the AI reasoning. The BALANCED TRADING MODE prioritizes capital preservation and requires strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators for trades, which is not present for a BUY given the high risk and bearish trend despite oversold conditions. Furthermore, our available cash ($111.32) is insufficient to purchase 1 share of MSFT at the current price ($516.89), making a BUY order impossible due to portfolio constraints. We hold 0 shares, so a SELL action is also not possible. Therefore, the most prudent action is to HOLD, observing the market for clearer signals or a confirmed trend reversal.",

The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, indicating a 'BEARISH' trend with 'HIGH' confidence. This strong bearish alignment would typically suggest a SELL action, with a technical score qualifying for high priority. However, the momentum indicators, specifically Williams %R (-86.0) and Stochastic K (14.0) and D (22.7), indicate oversold conditions. More critically, the AI Trend Analysis identifies a \"HIGH\" risk level. In BALANCED TRADING MODE, capital preservation is prioritized, and trades are to be avoided during high volatility/risk periods. Initiating a new short position (current position 0 shares) in a high-risk, oversold environment carries significant potential for a short-term rebound, conflicting with the strategy's risk aversion. No news data is available, so sentiment is neutral. Given the conflict between strong bearish technicals and the high risk/oversold conditions, capital preservation dictates holding rather than initiating a high-risk trade.",

      "reasoning": "TSLA exhibits a mixed technical picture. While the AI trend analysis confirms a bullish trend, supported by the current price remaining above both SMA 20 and SMA 50, critical momentum indicators are showing signs of weakness. The MACD line is below its signal line and the histogram is negative, indicating bearish momentum. Similarly, the Stochastic K line has crossed below the D line, also signaling weakening upward momentum. The OBV is negative, suggesting a lack of buying pressure or increased selling. Furthermore, the volume data is invalid, preventing proper volume confirmation for any significant price move. Given the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' requirement for multiple confirming indicators and strong technical alignment for high-priority trades, the divergence between the bullish trend and weakening momentum, coupled with missing volume data, makes both a BUY and a SELL less attractive at this time. Capital preservation dictates holding the current position until clearer signals emerge or momentum realigns with the trend.",

With a current price of $355.26 and usable cash of only $21.32 ($111.32 available - $90 min reserve), a purchase of 1 share is not feasible. From a technical perspective, the stock presents mixed signals. While deeply oversold momentum indicators (RSI at 24.8, Williams %R at -87.9, Stochastic K at 12.1) suggest a high probability of an imminent price bounce, the stock remains in a short-term bearish trend, trading below all key moving averages (SMA 20, SMA 50, EMA 12, EMA 26) with negative MACD momentum. The AI trend analysis indicates a \"BEARISH\" trend with \"HIGH\" risk. In BALANCED TRADING MODE, which prioritizes capital preservation and requires \"strong technical alignment\" for high-priority trades, this mixed scenario (bearish trend vs. oversold bounce) coupled with high risk does not meet the criteria for a BUY. The calculated technical score of 5.5 is below the required 6+ for a high-priority BUY. No news data is available, so news sentiment is neutral and does not influence the decision.",

Volume data is unavailable, preventing crucial confirmation of any price moves. Critically, with an available cash of $111.32 and a minimum cash reserve of $90, only $21.32 is available for trading, which is insufficient to purchase 1 share of AAPL at $231.03. Therefore, no BUY trade can be executed due to funding constraints. We also hold 0 shares, so a SELL is not possible.

Even if financial constraints were not an issue, the technical indicators present a mixed and contradictory picture, lacking the \"multiple confirming indicators\" and \"strong technical alignment\" required for a high-priority trade in Balanced Trading Mode. While MACD shows bullish momentum (histogram positive, line above signal), suggesting a potential short-term upward move, longer-term moving averages (SMA 50, EMA 26) indicate the price is below them, suggesting a medium-term downtrend. Crucially, Stochastic is in overbought territory (K=71.4, D=85.0) and shows a bearish cross (K < D), which is a strong counter-signal for a BUY. The AI Trend also indicates NEUTRAL with a \"strong underlying downtrend.\" Without clear, consistent signals and with conflicting momentum and trend indicators, initiating a trade would violate capital preservation principles.

AMZN is significantly overbought according to RSI (71.5), Williams %R (-14.1), and both Stochastic K (85.9) and D (90.7), suggesting a high probability of an imminent pullback. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, indicating a \"BEARISH\" trend with \"MEDIUM\" confidence and \"HIGH\" risk due to overbought conditions. While MACD shows a bullish crossover and the price is above key moving averages, these signals are heavily contradicted by the overwhelming overbought momentum, failing the \"demand multiple confirming indicators\" and \"focus on strong technical alignment\" criteria for a BUY in a balanced trading mode. Crucially, volume data is missing, preventing a comprehensive technical assessment. The balanced trading mode prioritizes capital preservation and avoids trades during high volatility or conflicting signals, which is the case for a potential BUY here.

While momentum indicators such as RSI (23.2), Williams %R (-92.0), and Stochastic (K: 8.0, D: 10.5) show extreme oversold conditions, these do not negate the dominant bearish trend as per the AI reasoning. The BALANCED TRADING MODE prioritizes capital preservation and requires strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators for trades, which is not present for a BUY given the high risk and bearish trend despite oversold conditions. Furthermore, our available cash ($111.32) is insufficient to purchase 1 share of MSFT at the current price ($516.89), making a BUY order impossible due to portfolio constraints.

The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, indicating a 'BEARISH' trend with 'HIGH' confidence. This strong bearish alignment would typically suggest a SELL action, with a technical score qualifying for high priority. However, the momentum indicators, specifically Williams %R (-86.0) and Stochastic K (14.0) and D (22.7), indicate oversold conditions. More critically, the AI Trend Analysis identifies a \"HIGH\" risk level. In BALANCED TRADING MODE, capital preservation is prioritized, and trades are to be avoided during high volatility/risk periods. Initiating a new short position (current position 0 shares) in a high-risk, oversold environment carries significant potential for a short-term rebound, conflicting with the strategy's risk aversion. No news data is available, so sentiment is neutral.

The MACD line is below its signal line and the histogram is negative, indicating bearish momentum. Similarly, the Stochastic K line has crossed below the D line, also signaling weakening upward momentum. The OBV is negative, suggesting a lack of buying pressure or increased selling. Furthermore, the volume data is invalid, preventing proper volume confirmation for any significant price move. Given the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' requirement for multiple confirming indicators and strong technical alignment for high-priority trades, the divergence between the bullish trend and weakening momentum, coupled with missing volume data, makes both a BUY and a SELL less attractive at this time.

The price is also positioned within the Bollinger Bands, above the middle band, indicating short-term strength.

While these technicals would align with a SELL signal, our current position for NVDA is 0 shares, making a SELL action impossible. Furthermore, with an available cash balance of $111.32, purchasing 1 share at $181.53 is not feasible due to insufficient funds. No news data is available, so sentiment is neutral and does not override the strong technical signals or financial constraints.

Critically, volume data is missing/negative, which prevents confirmation of price action and significantly reduces confidence for any high-priority directional trade. Furthermore, available cash ($111.32) does not permit a buy order of 1 share while maintaining the minimum cash reserve of $90.

While some indicators (Stochastic K, Stochastic D, Williams %R) show oversold conditions, suggesting a potential for a bounce, these do not provide sufficient strong technical alignment for a high-priority BUY, especially given the prevailing bearish trend.

Furthermore, with 0 shares held, a SELL action is not applicable. From a technical analysis perspective, a BUY recommendation is strongly advised against even if cash were available. While MACD shows a bullish crossover and the price is above the SMA 20, critical momentum indicators like Williams %R (-15.3) and Stochastic K (84.7) and D (90.7) are deeply in overbought territory. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, indicating a BEARISH trend with MEDIUM confidence and HIGH risk, specifically noting overbought momentum signaling a potential pullback. This combination of overbought conditions and the overall bearish trend from the AI contradicts the requirements for a high-priority BUY (technical score 6+) under the Balanced Trading Mode, which prioritizes capital preservation and strong technical alignment. Due to financial constraints and highly conflicting/bearish technical signals from momentum and trend analysis, no trade should be initiated.",

The Stochastic K is also below D, signaling a potential bearish divergence within the overbought territory, suggesting an imminent pullback or consolidation. The AI trend analysis confirms a BEARISH trend with HIGH risk, attributing this to the strong overbought signals and a weak ADX trend. This mixed technical picture lacks the strong alignment required for a BUY signal (technical score 6+) under the Balanced Trading Mode, which prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators. Furthermore, with the current price of $230.59 and only $111.32 in available cash, a BUY order for 1 share is not feasible due to portfolio constraints, which supersede any potential technical signal. Since there are 0 shares currently held, a SELL action is also not possible.",

The AI Trend analysis confirms a High Confidence Bullish trend. This robust technical alignment generates a high technical score. However, despite these strong buy signals and the favorable technical outlook, a BUY action is not possible due to insufficient available cash ($111.32) to purchase even a single share of NFLX at its current price of $1247.33. The portfolio constraints dictate capital preservation and adherence to available funds. No news data is available, so sentiment is neutral and does not influence the decision.

With a current price of $517.09 and only $111.32 in available cash, purchasing even 1 share of MSFT is not possible while adhering to the minimum cash reserve constraint of $90. Furthermore, even if cash were not a constraint, the technical signals for MSFT are conflicting. While MSFT is exhibiting extreme oversold conditions across multiple momentum indicators (RSI at 23.2, Williams %R at -99.4, Stochastic K at 0.6), suggesting a potential short-term rebound, the price remains below all key moving averages (SMA 20, SMA 50, EMA 12, EMA 26), indicating a prevailing bearish trend. The MACD lines are also in bearish territory. The AI trend analysis identifies the trend as NEUTRAL with HIGH Risk. Under the BALANCED TRADING MODE, which prioritizes capital preservation, demands strong technical alignment, and avoids high-risk trades, these conflicting signals do not provide the clear, confirming alignment required for a high-priority BUY (technical score 6+).

Furthermore, the technical analysis presents a strongly bearish picture, with the MACD line below its signal, price trading below short-term moving averages (SMA 20, EMA 12, EMA 26), and below the middle Bollinger Band. The AI trend analysis confirms a high-confidence bearish trend with high risk. While momentum indicators (RSI, Stochastic, Williams %R) show oversold conditions, these indicate prolonged weakness rather than a confirmed reversal suitable for a BUY in a balanced trading mode, which requires technical scores of 6+ for high-priority buys and strong confirming indicators. A SELL action is not possible as there is no existing position (0 shares) in NVDA. Therefore, no action can or should be taken at this time given the constraints and bearish technicals.",

However, recent momentum indicators present conflicting signals, with MACD showing a bearish crossover (Line below Signal) and Stochastic also indicating a bearish crossover from overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term weakening of momentum or minor correction. The volume data provided is problematic, hindering a clear assessment of market conviction. Given the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE's' emphasis on capital preservation, requiring multiple confirming indicators for high-priority trades, and the current lack of strong technical alignment due to these conflicting signals, a BUY recommendation is not justified (Technical Score below 6 and insufficient cash). A SELL is also not warranted as the strong underlying trend contradicts a high-priority sell (Technical Score not 4 or below).

While momentum oscillators like RSI (36.9), Williams %R (-68.0), and Stochastic (D: 25.5) are in the lower range, approaching oversold conditions, they do not yet confirm strong reversal or buy signals required for a balanced trading approach. The AI Trend analysis confirms a NEUTRAL trend with MEDIUM confidence, indicating limited downside or potential for a bounce, but not a clear direction. Volume data is unavailable, preventing crucial confirmation of any price moves. Critically, with an available cash of $111.32 and a minimum cash reserve of $90, only $21.32 is available for trading, which is insufficient to purchase 1 share of AAPL at $231.03. Therefore, no BUY trade can be executed due to funding constraints. We also hold 0 shares, so a SELL is not possible.

While MACD shows bullish momentum (histogram positive, line above signal), suggesting a potential short-term upward move, longer-term moving averages (SMA 50, EMA 26) indicate the price is below them, suggesting a medium-term downtrend. Crucially, Stochastic is in overbought territory (K=71.4, D=85.0) and shows a bearish cross (K < D), which is a strong counter-signal for a BUY. The AI Trend also indicates NEUTRAL with a \"strong underlying downtrend.\" Without clear, consistent signals and with conflicting momentum and trend indicators, initiating a trade would violate capital preservation principles.

AMZN is significantly overbought according to RSI (71.5), Williams %R (-14.1), and both Stochastic K (85.9) and D (90.7), suggesting a high probability of an imminent pullback. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, indicating a \"BEARISH\" trend with \"MEDIUM\" confidence and \"HIGH\" risk due to overbought conditions. While MACD shows a bullish crossover and the price is above key moving averages, these signals are heavily contradicted by the overwhelming overbought momentum, failing the \"demand multiple confirming indicators\" and \"focus on strong technical alignment\" criteria for a BUY in a balanced trading mode. Crucially, volume data is missing, preventing a comprehensive technical assessment. The balanced trading mode prioritizes capital preservation and avoids trades during high volatility or conflicting signals, which is the case for a potential BUY here.

While momentum indicators such as RSI (23.2), Williams %R (-92.0), and Stochastic (K: 8.0, D: 10.5) show extreme oversold conditions, these do not negate the dominant bearish trend as per the AI reasoning. The BALANCED TRADING MODE prioritizes capital preservation and requires strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators for trades, which is not present for a BUY given the high risk and bearish trend despite oversold conditions. Furthermore, our available cash ($111.32) is insufficient to purchase 1 share of MSFT at the current price ($516.89), making a BUY order impossible due to portfolio constraints.

The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, indicating a 'BEARISH' trend with 'HIGH' confidence. This strong bearish alignment would typically suggest a SELL action, with a technical score qualifying for high priority. However, the momentum indicators, specifically Williams %R (-86.0) and Stochastic K (14.0) and D (22.7), indicate oversold conditions. More critically, the AI Trend Analysis identifies a \"HIGH\" risk level. In BALANCED TRADING MODE, capital preservation is prioritized, and trades are to be avoided during high volatility/risk periods. Initiating a new short position (current position 0 shares) in a high-risk, oversold environment carries significant potential for a short-term rebound, conflicting with the strategy's risk aversion.

Similarly, the Stochastic K line has crossed below the D line, also signaling weakening upward momentum. The OBV is negative, suggesting a lack of buying pressure or increased selling. Furthermore, the volume data is invalid, preventing proper volume confirmation for any significant price move. Given the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' requirement for multiple confirming indicators and strong technical alignment for high-priority trades, the divergence between the bullish trend and weakening momentum, coupled with missing volume data, makes both a BUY and a SELL less attractive at this time.
