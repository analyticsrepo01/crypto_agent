The MACD histogram is significantly negative (-3.489), and the MACD line (-0.530) is below its signal line (2.959), confirming strong bearish momentum. This negative price action is heavily confirmed by an exceptionally high current volume (77,949,221) and a massive volume ratio (30817779.14x average), indicating strong selling pressure. The AI trend analysis reinforces this with a ""BEARISH"" trend and ""HIGH"" confidence, explicitly stating price is below key moving averages and confirmed by high volume.

Given the aggressive trading mode's emphasis on momentum and volume, the strong bullish signals are noteworthy, but the strong overbought warnings and potential for a pullback temper the enthusiasm for a new BUY entry.
