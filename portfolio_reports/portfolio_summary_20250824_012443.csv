The price is currently trading above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating an established short-term uptrend. Critically, the current volume is extraordinarily high, with a volume ratio of 30566206.67x average, which provides robust confirmation of strong buying interest and momentum – a key priority in aggressive trading. While Stochastic K (90.9) and Williams %R (-9.1) indicate heavily overbought conditions suggesting a potential near-term reversal or pullback, the aggressive trading strategy prioritizes maximizing profit through decisive action, accepting higher risk for higher potential returns by capitalizing on strong, confirmed momentum. The technical score of 6 meets the aggressive mode threshold for a BUY action (4+).

The current price of $2482.93 is above the calculated 2% stop-loss threshold of $2434.075. Therefore, a sell action is not permissible at this time. Technical analysis for the 5-minute timeframe presents mixed signals: price is above both the SMA 20 ($2481.31) and SMA 50 ($2481.83), suggesting minor bullish pressure. However, MACD (line at -0.399, signal at -0.321, histogram at -0.078) shows bearish momentum. RSI (46.7), Williams %R (-40.1), and Stochastic K (59.9) are all in neutral territory.

The AI trend analysis indicates a ""BULLISH"" trend but with ""LOW Confidence"" and a ""HIGH Risk"" level, citing that the asset is ""significantly overbought"" and suggesting a potential short-term correction. Given the aggressive trading mode, a strong and clear signal across both momentum and trend is required for decisive action. The current mixed technicals, lack of 1-hour data, neutral momentum indicators, and the AI's ""overbought"" warning do not provide a sufficiently strong BUY signal (Technical Score not strongly >4) for a new entry.
