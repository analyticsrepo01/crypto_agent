The current price ($107807.83) is confidently trading above both the SMA 20 ($107764.71) and SMA 50 ($107762.55), confirming a strong upward trend. The MACD shows robust bullish momentum with a positive and expanding histogram (6.568) and the MACD line (7.950) well above its signal line (1.382), which is a highly reliable indicator in trending crypto markets. Critically, the Current Volume (70,842,291) and an exceptionally high Volume Ratio (28750631.45x average) indicate strong buying interest and provide substantial confirmation for the bullish move. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, identifying a ""BULLISH"" trend due to consistent price action above MAs and the strong MACD, despite some minor momentum indicators (Williams %R -78.5, Stochastic K 21.5) showing slight short-term exhaustion (which are not extreme enough to override the dominant bullish signals for crypto).

In an aggressive trading mode, clear momentum and strong technical signals (score 4+ for BUY, 6- for SELL) are paramount.
