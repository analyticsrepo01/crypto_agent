This does not meet the mandatory profitability threshold for selling and is significantly below the 2%+ stop-loss trigger. Therefore, according to critical fee-aware sell rules, the position must be held. Furthermore, the overall technical analysis presents a neutral to slightly conflicting picture, with a bullish MACD crossover countered by the current price trading below both the 20-period and 50-period SMAs, and a negative daily change.

Despite this, the underlying technical analysis indicates a strong bearish trend: the price ($2480.44) is consistently below both the SMA 20 ($2482.43) and SMA 50 ($2482.28). MACD shows a strong bearish crossover with a negative histogram (-0.122) and the MACD line (-0.216) is below its signal line (-0.094). RSI is at 40.0, indicating bearish momentum but not oversold.

Critically, current volume is exceptionally high (5,000,000) compared to its zero volume MA, a strong momentum signal for aggressive strategies, suggesting significant buying interest. The AI Trend Analysis confirms a BULLISH trend, albeit with MEDIUM confidence and notes a ""weak bullish trend"" and potential ""overbought Bollinger Band,"" indicating some caution. However, the UNPROFITABLE status of the current position ($ -0.01 net P&L) prevents a SELL decision unless it's a stop-loss, which is not applicable here (0% loss). Given the positive price action, high volume, and bullish AI trend, a tactical BUY is warranted to capitalize on potential upside, aligning with the aggressive mandate to maximize profit by taking decisive action even with higher risk and mixed technical signals.
