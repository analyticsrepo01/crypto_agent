The AI Trend Analysis explicitly identifies a BEARISH trend with HIGH risk, citing these overbought conditions and predicting a probable short-term pullback. While MACD and Moving Averages show minor bullishness, they are heavily outweighed by the strong and consistent overbought signals. According to the BALANCED TRADING MODE, a technical score of 4- or less mandates a high-priority SELL, and the multitude of strong bearish indicators aligns perfectly with this criterion. Selling the current 1 share position aligns with capital preservation, reduces exposure to a high-risk overbought asset, and realizes a small profit from the last buy.",N/A,181.91,181.91,621,Filled,1.0,0.0,181.895,1.013563,959.44,314.85,1
