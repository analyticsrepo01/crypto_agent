Crucially, volume is exceptionally high (34208.58x average), signifying strong buying interest and confirmation of the bullish trend, which is a key priority in aggressive trading. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this with a HIGH confidence BULLISH outlook, attributing the oversold momentum indicators (Williams %R -96.1, Stochastic K 3.9) as supporting a strong upward bias (potential for a bounce from a short-term dip within an uptrend). Despite missing 1-hour data, the overwhelming strength in the 5-minute timeframe, especially the extreme volume and clear price/MACD alignment, warrants an aggressive BUY. Our current position is profitable, suggesting a favorable underlying trend to add to.
