Momentum indicators Williams %R (-4.8) and Stochastic K (95.2) are both deeply in overbought territory, suggesting a high probability of a bearish pullback, which aligns with the AI trend analysis. The current price ($107700.02) is below both the 20-period SMA ($107791.66) and 50-period SMA ($107771.18), indicating short-term bearish pressure. Current volume is extremely high (78,820,751), with a significant volume ratio, which, when coupled with the negative daily change (-0.20%), reinforces the bearish conviction. While the MACD shows bullish momentum (MACD Line 10.013 > Signal 4.389), the strong overbought readings from other momentum indicators, the price action below key moving averages, and the AI's ""BEARISH"" trend with ""HIGH"" risk level outweigh this single bullish signal. Given the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, we prioritize momentum and volume; the overbought signals and high volume with negative price action indicate a higher risk for a BUY entry.
