This strongly supports a SELL bias. However, several critical short-term momentum indicators such as Williams %R (-89.0), Stochastic K (11.0), and Stochastic D (11.8) are deep in oversold territory. The price is also at the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting a potential short-term bounce or consolidation. In ""BALANCED TRADING MODE"", capital preservation and requiring multiple *confirming* indicators are paramount. The conflict between the strong bearish trend and the immediate oversold conditions introduces short-term uncertainty and higher risk for initiating a new SELL trade, as it could mean selling at a temporary bottom. Therefore, despite the bearish bias, it is prudent to HOLD (take no action) and await better technical alignment or a short-term rebound before considering a SELL position.

The current price ($765.34) is trading below both the SMA 20 ($765.48) and SMA 50 ($768.74), indicating a downtrend. Further confirming this weakness, the EMA 12 ($765.53) is below the EMA 26 ($766.31), signaling a bearish crossover. The Stochastic K (48.5) is also below Stochastic D (58.8), which is a bearish momentum signal. The AI Trend Analysis explicitly categorizes the trend as 'BEARISH' with 'MEDIUM' confidence, citing price trading below bearishly crossed moving averages. While MACD shows a bullish crossover (Line -0.775 > Signal -1.121) and a positive histogram (0.345), these are outweighed by the multiple confirming bearish indicators. The overall technical score is 2, which falls well below the 6+ requirement for a high-priority BUY and strongly aligns with the 4- threshold for a high-priority SELL. Since the current position for META is 0 shares, and in 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' prioritizing capital preservation, initiating a short position is not advisable without explicit instruction, nor is a long position given the strong bearish technicals.
