For new potential trades, the technical signals are conflicting. Price is currently trading above both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating weak short-term bullishness, and this is supported by extremely high volume, which signifies strong market activity. However, the MACD shows a clear bearish crossover, a reliable and strong bearish signal for crypto markets. Other momentum indicators like RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic are perfectly neutral. The AI trend analysis confirms this mixed picture, identifying a ""BULLISH"" trend but with ""LOW confidence"" and ""HIGH risk"" due to ""significant conflicting signals, warranting caution."" While the aggressive trading mode encourages decisive action, the lack of clear directional conviction, coupled with strong conflicting momentum indicators and the AI's cautionary stance, dictates a HOLD.

Despite the aggressive trading mode, realizing a loss without a specific stop-loss condition is explicitly prohibited. Technical analysis shows mixed signals on the 5-minute timeframe: price is below bearishly aligned SMA 20 and SMA 50, and the AI trend analysis indicates a BEARISH trend with medium confidence, supported by high volume interpreted as selling pressure. However, momentum indicators like MACD Histogram (positive) and Stochastic K (79.9, near overbought) show some short-term bullish momentum. Given the absence of 1-hour timeframe data, a critical component for trend confirmation, and the conflicting short-term signals, there is no strong actionable BUY signal (Technical score not 4+).
