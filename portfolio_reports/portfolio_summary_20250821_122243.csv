Both Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are in strong buying territory, signaling robust upward pressure, which aggressive trading prioritizes.

Volume is extremely high (706351.06x average), indicating significant market interest and potential for decisive price movement, a key factor for aggressive strategies. Although the AI mentions conflicting negative OBV and lack of ADX strength suggesting consolidation, the dominant bullish signals from multiple momentum and trend-following indicators, coupled with the aggressive trading mandate to prioritize momentum and volume, outweigh these caveats.
