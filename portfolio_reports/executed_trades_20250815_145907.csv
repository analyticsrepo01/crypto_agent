session_20250815_144412_6575,3,BALANCED,2025-08-15T14:57:25.465546,ADBE,SELL,2,MEDIUM,"Current position of 2 shares. The technical score is 4.0/10 (WEAK_BEARISH), aligning with the requirement for a sell consideration. MACD histogram is negative, and there are more bearish key signals (3.5) than bullish (2.5). The AI trend is BEARISH, though with HIGH risk. While the technical score of 4.0 falls within the range for a high-priority SELL (4-), the 'WEAK_BEARISH' rating and high AI risk, combined with the previous validation feedback on 'low technical confidence' for a high-priority sell, lead to a MEDIUM priority. No news sentiment implies technicals are the primary driver. Selling this position will also increase available cash above the $90 minimum reserve, which is crucial for maintaining portfolio health.",N/A,353.31,706.62,91,Filled,2.0,0.0,353.39,1.026254,993.58,794.57,2
