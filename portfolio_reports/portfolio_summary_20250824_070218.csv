As per mandatory trading rules, selling an unprofitable position that is not at a 2%+ stop-loss is prohibited. The current loss of 0.0193% is well below the stop-loss threshold. For new actions, the 5-minute timeframe shows mixed signals: bullish momentum from MACD (0.542 > 0.335) and price holding above both SMA 20 ($2482.80) and SMA 50 ($2482.33) suggests underlying strength. However, aggressive short-term momentum indicators like Williams %R (-0.2) and Stochastic K (99.8) are extremely overbought, indicating potential for a pullback or consolidation, which aligns with the 0% daily price change and the AI's ""NEUTRAL"" trend assessment with ""limited immediate upside"". The exceptionally high volume ratio (715510.79x average) shows strong market interest but has not translated into price movement, suggesting a stall. The absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents crucial medium-term trend confirmation, further reducing conviction for any aggressive new entry.
