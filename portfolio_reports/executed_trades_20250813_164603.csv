The MACD Histogram is negative, and the AI Trend is BEARISH, providing confirming indicators. The current position is 10 shares, which aligns perfectly with the ""Trade size: 10 shares per order"" constraint, allowing for a direct sell. With no conflicting news, this is a clear sell signal for capital preservation.",N/A,289.48,2894.8,29,Filled,10.0,0.0,287.91,1.243987,999684.82,994471.14,2,

However, the RSI is high at 69.7 (approaching overbought), MACD Histogram is negative, and volume is below average. While the technical score is strong enough for a BUY, the lack of strong confirming indicators (like positive MACD histogram, lower RSI for better entry, and higher volume) in a balanced trading mode, along with no news, warrants a MEDIUM priority. We prioritize capital preservation and demand multiple confirming indicators.",N/A,232.88,,31,Filled,10.0,0.0,232.95,1.241927,999684.82,994471.14,2,2328.8
