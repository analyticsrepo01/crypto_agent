However, this is contradicted by extreme oversold conditions (Williams %R -100, Stochastic K 0), which suggest a potential for a short-term bounce or a pause in the downtrend. The extremely high volume with static price indicates current consolidation and lack of clear directional momentum, further supporting a wait-and-see approach.

Per the critical fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position must be held unless a stop-loss is triggered. From a technical standpoint, the 5-minute analysis shows mixed signals: the AI trend identifies a BULLISH trajectory due to price being above key moving averages and positive volume, but critically notes the asset is ""significantly overbought"" and trading above its upper Bollinger Band, suggesting a potential short-term pullback. Momentum indicators (RSI 50.0, flat MACD) are neutral. The lack of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a robust dual-timeframe confirmation.
