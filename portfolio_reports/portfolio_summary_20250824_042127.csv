This is supported by the 5-minute technical indicators: the current price ($107700.02) is trading below both the SMA 20 ($107786.27) and SMA 50 ($107775.49), a clear bearish signal. Furthermore, a bearish MACD crossover is evident (MACD Line 6.171 < MACD Signal 7.926) with a negative MACD Histogram (-1.756), confirming downward momentum. The daily price change is also negative (-0.10%), and current volume is extremely high (78,118,328, 31517236.16x average), which tends to confirm the prevailing trend, which is bearish. Despite these strong bearish technical signals, the current BTCUSD position is UNPROFITABLE (Net P&L After Fees: $-0.76) and does not meet the 2%+ stop-loss trigger. Therefore, adhering strictly to the critical fee-aware sell rules, the position MUST be HELD to avoid realizing a loss, as selling an unprofitable position is prohibited outside of stop-loss conditions.

The 5-minute technical indicators reinforce this bearish sentiment: the current price ($2480.44) is below both the SMA 20 ($2482.30) and SMA 50 ($2482.38), and the MACD line is below its signal line with a negative histogram. The extremely high Volume Ratio (719461.53x average) alongside the significant current volume (77,659,347) further confirms strong bearish momentum. While RSI is at 33.3, it is not yet in extreme oversold territory (<20) to suggest an immediate bounce.",5.0,LOW,BEARISH,HIGH,MEDIUM,33.31094694425842,2482.3005000000003,2482.3754,-0.055120325861010844,-0.09988239653311497,719461.5343449583,AGGRESSIVE

The MACD Line (0.004) is above its Signal Line (0.002) with a positive Histogram, signaling bullish momentum. The current price ($120.42) is trading above both the SMA 20 ($120.36) and SMA 50 ($120.36), further confirming an upward short-term trend. Critically, the current volume is extremely high (34172.89x average), which provides strong confirmation for the bullish move and sustained buying interest, a key factor for aggressive trading. While Williams %R (-0.0) and Stochastic K (100.0) indicate overbought conditions, the overall technical strength, combined with the AI's explicit reasoning acknowledging these conditions but still confirming a strong upward momentum, suggests that in an aggressive, crypto-adjusted trading context, the trend is likely to persist. My current position is profitable (Net P&L: +$0.12), and the technical score of 7 (above the 6- SELL threshold) does not trigger a sell. Given the directives to maximize profit and accept higher risk with strong momentum, holding this profitable position aligns best with the aggressive strategy, allowing for potential further upside. I am currently over the maximum shares per stock limit (5.4015 shares vs. max 5), which prevents any additional BUY orders.",7.0,HIGH,BULLISH,HIGH,MEDIUM,50.0,120.35999999999999,120.35520000000001,0.002453306242120489,0.0997506234414003,34172.886526212176,AGGRESSIVE

Therefore, a HOLD is required for the existing position. For any new trading action, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which is critical for establishing a strong directional trend as per the instruction to ""Weight 1-hour trends MORE heavily than 5-minute for direction."" While current 5-minute volume is extremely high (5,000,000, 5000000.00x average), indicating strong market activity, the MACD and RSI are neutral (0.000 and 50.0 respectively), and price action shows only a modest daily change of +0.37%. The AI trend analysis is 'BULLISH' with 'MEDIUM' confidence, but explicitly warns of a ""potential for a short-term pullback,"" despite its reference to ""positive MACD signals"" which contradicts the provided neutral MACD data. Given the lack of reliable 1-hour trend confirmation and the AI's warning of a potential pullback, initiating a new BUY order carries undue risk for an aggressive strategy aiming to maximize profit quickly. A HOLD is the most prudent action to avoid entering into a potential downturn and to await clearer, fully confirmed directional signals.",5.0,MEDIUM,BULLISH,MEDIUM,HIGH,50.0,575.53,575.53,3.786445339308431e-09,0.37009365280697715,5000000.0,AGGRESSIVE
