Price is trading significantly below both the SMA 20 ($107748.53) and SMA 50 ($107756.08), with the shorter-term SMA below the longer-term, indicating a clear downtrend. The MACD shows a strong bearish crossover with a negative and widening histogram (-3.013), confirming increasing downward momentum. The RSI (40.0) is in bearish territory, and Williams %R (-40.0) also indicates weakness. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, identifying a BEARISH trend with HIGH confidence. Furthermore, the extremely high Volume Ratio (30595718.60x average) suggests that the current bearish move is accompanied by significant conviction.
