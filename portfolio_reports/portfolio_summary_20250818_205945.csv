The AI Trend Analysis confirms a HIGH confidence BULLISH trend. However, crucial short-term indicators such as RSI (67.2), Williams %R (-16.0), and Stochastic K (84.0) are all indicating overbought conditions on the 5-minute chart. This suggests a potential for a short-term pullback or consolidation, which conflicts with the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE's' emphasis on capital preservation and avoiding trades during high volatility periods. Most importantly, no 1-hour timeframe data is available, preventing the essential medium-term trend confirmation and dual timeframe alignment required for a high-confidence trade. As per the strategy, 1-hour trends are weighted more heavily, and high confidence is only achieved when both timeframes agree.
