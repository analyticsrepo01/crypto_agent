However, multiple critical momentum indicators (RSI at 82.9, Williams %R at -9.0, and Stochastic K/D at 91.0/95.8) are all signaling extremely overbought conditions, which strongly suggests an imminent pullback or consolidation. The price is also very close to the upper Bollinger Band, indicating potential overextension. The AI trend analysis, while generally bullish, explicitly identifies a ""HIGH"" risk level due to these overbought indicators and suggests a ""high probability of a short-term pullback or consolidation."" In a ""BALANCED TRADING MODE"" that prioritizes capital preservation, demands multiple confirming indicators for risk assessment, and aims to avoid trades during periods preceding high volatility, selling the existing share to realize current profits and mitigate the high risk of a short-term reversal is prudent. The absence of news data is neutral, not hindering the decision.",N/A,357.55,357.55,288,Filled,1.0,0.0,357.58,1.013076,962.99,564.81,3
