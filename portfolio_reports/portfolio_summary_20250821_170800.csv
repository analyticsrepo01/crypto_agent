Both Williams %R (-4.8) and Stochastic K (95.2) are in extremely overbought territory, which in a bearish context, strongly indicates a potential reversal and further downward price movement. The daily price change is negative (-0.10%). Crucially, the current volume is extraordinarily high (78,881,856) with an astronomical volume ratio, confirming strong conviction behind the current bearish price action. The AI Trend Analysis explicitly categorizes the trend as ""BEARISH"" with ""MEDIUM"" confidence, further strengthened by its ""STRONG_BEARISH"" technical strength assessment. Although 1-hour data is unavailable, the confluence of these aggressive bearish short-term indicators, coupled with the extremely high volume, triggers an immediate SELL action under the aggressive trading mode rules (technical score 6- is actionable).
