However, multiple critical short-term momentum indicators, specifically RSI (67.2), Williams %R (-16.0), and Stochastic K (84.0), are signaling overbought conditions. This indicates a high probability of a short-term pullback or consolidation, presenting an unfavorable entry point for a balanced strategy prioritizing capital preservation. The AI's trend analysis also confirms this overbought condition and the risk of a pullback. Furthermore, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents crucial medium-term trend confirmation, which is a key requirement for high-confidence trades in Balanced Trading Mode.
