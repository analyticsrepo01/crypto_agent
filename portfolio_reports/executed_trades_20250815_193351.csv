Volume is low, indicating stable conditions. While the technicals are strong enough for a high-priority BUY, the news sentiment is neutral to slightly negative (score: -0.20). Although this score does not strictly trigger the ""avoid BUY on sentiment < -0.2"" rule, it also does not provide positive alignment for a high-priority trade as required by the Balanced Trading Mode. Therefore, the trade is downgraded to a MEDIUM priority.",N/A,231.18,231.18,590,Filled,1.0,0.0,231.27,1.013959,974.33,743.1500000000001,4
