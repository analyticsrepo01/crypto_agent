      "reasoning": "The technical analysis for AAPL presents a predominantly bearish outlook, with the AI trend indicating BEARISH sentiment, price trading below all key moving averages (SMA 20, SMA 50, EMA 12, EMA 26), and MACD signaling bearish momentum. While momentum oscillators like Stochastic and Williams %R are deeply oversold, suggesting a potential short-term bounce, this is not indicative of a broader trend reversal and does not align with the capital preservation focus of the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE'. Furthermore, the news sentiment for AAPL is NEGATIVE (-0.40), which explicitly advises against BUY actions according to our strategy's rules (Avoid BUY on negative news (sentiment < -0.2)). Crucially, with only $85.20 available cash, we are below the minimum cash reserve of $90 and do not have sufficient funds to purchase a share of AAPL ($230.88). Since we currently hold 0 shares, a SELL action is not possible. Therefore, given the weak technical alignment for a BUY, negative news sentiment, and strict portfolio constraints, the only prudent action is to HOLD.",

This results in a very low technical score for a BUY recommendation. However, the news sentiment is strongly positive (+0.95) due to strong Q2 earnings and AI-driven ad growth. According to BALANCED TRADING MODE, a SELL trade must be avoided on strongly positive news (sentiment > +0.5), which directly conflicts with the bearish technicals that might otherwise suggest a SELL. Additionally, no shares of META are currently held in the portfolio, making a SELL action impossible. A BUY action is also not feasible as available cash ($85.20) is below the minimum cash reserve ($90) required to place an order. Given these conflicting signals and strict portfolio constraints, a HOLD decision is the only prudent action, prioritizing capital preservation and adherence to strategy rules.",

    "AMZN": {
      "action": "HOLD",

      "reasoning": "A BUY action for AMZN is strictly avoided due to multiple critical factors. Firstly, the news sentiment for AMZN is definitively NEGATIVE (-0.75), which directly violates the \"Avoid BUY on negative news (sentiment < -0.2)\" rule in balanced trading mode. Secondly, the available cash ($85.20) is below the minimum cash reserve ($90) and insufficient to purchase even 1 share of AMZN ($229.62), making a BUY impossible due to portfolio constraints. Technically, while MACD shows a recent bullish crossover, the price remains below all key moving averages (SMA 20, SMA 50, EMA 12, EMA 26) and the AI Trend Analysis indicates a BEARISH bias with medium confidence. The overall technical picture lacks the strong alignment and multiple confirming indicators required for a high-priority trade, especially for a BUY. Given 0 shares are held, a SELL action is not applicable. The combination of negative news, insufficient funds, and mixed/weakly bearish technicals warrants a strong HOLD.",

Available cash ($85.20) is significantly less than the current price of NFLX ($1242.07), preventing any BUY order. Additionally, initiating a BUY order would violate the minimum cash reserve of $90. A SELL order is not possible as 0 shares of NFLX are currently held. From a technical perspective, the indicators present a mixed picture: while long-term moving averages (SMA 20/50, EMA 12/26) suggest an underlying bullish trend and the AI trend analysis indicates a medium-confidence bullish trend, short-term momentum indicators (MACD and Stochastic) show bearish crossovers and negative daily price change, indicating recent weakness or consolidation. Crucially, the volume data is missing/invalid, which severely impacts the reliability and confirmation of any technical signals. News sentiment is neutral (+0.00), offering no strong directional bias. The 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' requires strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators, which are not present here. The technical score of 3 does not meet the 6+ threshold for a high-priority BUY or the 4- threshold for a high-priority SELL.",

If a trade were feasible, the news sentiment for NVDA is strongly NEGATIVE (score: -0.70), which directly conflicts with any BUY consideration according to the Balanced Trading Mode rules (\"Avoid BUY on negative news\"). Technically, while momentum indicators (RSI: 32.5, Williams %R: -90.5, Stochastic K: 9.5) indicate oversold conditions that might suggest a potential bounce, the AI trend analysis identifies a strong established BEARISH trend with HIGH confidence, supported by MACD (bearish crossover, negative histogram) and short-term moving averages (price below SMA 20, EMA 12, EMA 26). This presents conflicting technical signals (oversold vs. strong downtrend), which combined with the negative news and strict cash constraints, strongly dictates a HOLD decision to prioritize capital preservation and avoid trades during periods of ambiguity or prohibitive portfolio constraints.",

The conflicting technical signals (bullish trend vs. bearish short-term momentum) do not provide the strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators required for a high-priority trade in Balanced Trading Mode.

Furthermore, the news sentiment for AAPL is NEGATIVE (-0.40), which explicitly advises against BUY actions according to our strategy's rules (Avoid BUY on negative news (sentiment < -0.2)). Crucially, with only $85.20 available cash, we are below the minimum cash reserve of $90 and do not have sufficient funds to purchase a share of AAPL ($230.88).

According to BALANCED TRADING MODE, a SELL trade must be avoided on strongly positive news (sentiment > +0.5), which directly conflicts with the bearish technicals that might otherwise suggest a SELL.

Secondly, the available cash ($85.20) is below the minimum cash reserve ($90) and insufficient to purchase even 1 share of AMZN ($229.62), making a BUY impossible due to portfolio constraints. Technically, while MACD shows a recent bullish crossover, the price remains below all key moving averages (SMA 20, SMA 50, EMA 12, EMA 26) and the AI Trend Analysis indicates a BEARISH bias with medium confidence.

A SELL order is not possible as 0 shares of NFLX are currently held. From a technical perspective, the indicators present a mixed picture: while long-term moving averages (SMA 20/50, EMA 12/26) suggest an underlying bullish trend and the AI trend analysis indicates a medium-confidence bullish trend, short-term momentum indicators (MACD and Stochastic) show bearish crossovers and negative daily price change, indicating recent weakness or consolidation. Crucially, the volume data is missing/invalid, which severely impacts the reliability and confirmation of any technical signals. News sentiment is neutral (+0.00), offering no strong directional bias. The 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' requires strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators, which are not present here.

This presents conflicting technical signals (oversold vs. strong downtrend), which combined with the negative news and strict cash constraints, strongly dictates a HOLD decision to prioritize capital preservation and avoid trades during periods of ambiguity or prohibitive portfolio constraints.",

While momentum oscillators like Stochastic and Williams %R are deeply oversold, suggesting a potential short-term bounce, this is not indicative of a broader trend reversal and does not align with the capital preservation focus of the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE'. Furthermore, the news sentiment for AAPL is NEGATIVE (-0.40), which explicitly advises against BUY actions according to our strategy's rules (Avoid BUY on negative news (sentiment < -0.2)). Crucially, with only $85.20 available cash, we are below the minimum cash reserve of $90 and do not have sufficient funds to purchase a share of AAPL ($230.88). Since we currently hold 0 shares, a SELL action is not possible. Therefore, given the weak technical alignment for a BUY, negative news sentiment, and strict portfolio constraints, the only prudent action is to HOLD.",

This results in a very low technical score for a BUY recommendation. However, the news sentiment is strongly positive (+0.95) due to strong Q2 earnings and AI-driven ad growth. According to BALANCED TRADING MODE, a SELL trade must be avoided on strongly positive news (sentiment > +0.5), which directly conflicts with the bearish technicals that might otherwise suggest a SELL. Additionally, no shares of META are currently held in the portfolio, making a SELL action impossible. A BUY action is also not feasible as available cash ($85.20) is below the minimum cash reserve ($90) required to place an order.

Secondly, the available cash ($85.20) is below the minimum cash reserve ($90) and insufficient to purchase even 1 share of AMZN ($229.62), making a BUY impossible due to portfolio constraints. Technically, while MACD shows a recent bullish crossover, the price remains below all key moving averages (SMA 20, SMA 50, EMA 12, EMA 26) and the AI Trend Analysis indicates a BEARISH bias with medium confidence. The overall technical picture lacks the strong alignment and multiple confirming indicators required for a high-priority trade, especially for a BUY.

A SELL order is not possible as 0 shares of NFLX are currently held. From a technical perspective, the indicators present a mixed picture: while long-term moving averages (SMA 20/50, EMA 12/26) suggest an underlying bullish trend and the AI trend analysis indicates a medium-confidence bullish trend, short-term momentum indicators (MACD and Stochastic) show bearish crossovers and negative daily price change, indicating recent weakness or consolidation. Crucially, the volume data is missing/invalid, which severely impacts the reliability and confirmation of any technical signals. News sentiment is neutral (+0.00), offering no strong directional bias. The 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' requires strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators, which are not present here.

Technically, while momentum indicators (RSI: 32.5, Williams %R: -90.5, Stochastic K: 9.5) indicate oversold conditions that might suggest a potential bounce, the AI trend analysis identifies a strong established BEARISH trend with HIGH confidence, supported by MACD (bearish crossover, negative histogram) and short-term moving averages (price below SMA 20, EMA 12, EMA 26). This presents conflicting technical signals (oversold vs. strong downtrend), which combined with the negative news and strict cash constraints, strongly dictates a HOLD decision to prioritize capital preservation and avoid trades during periods of ambiguity or prohibitive portfolio constraints.",
