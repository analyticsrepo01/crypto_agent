According to the critical fee-aware sell rules, an unprofitable position must be held. Despite this, the underlying technicals are strongly bearish: the price ($107700.02) is well below the SMA 20 ($107748.54) and SMA 50 ($107766.86), the MACD shows a bearish crossover (MACD Line 4.004 below Signal 10.141) with a negative histogram (-6.137), and the AI Trend Analysis confirms a HIGH confidence BEARISH trend.

Despite the existing position being currently unprofitable to sell (and thus held in accordance with the mandatory sell rules), all indicators point to strong upward momentum, making it an opportune time to increase exposure. Price is trading robustly above both the SMA 20 ($2482.43) and SMA 50 ($2482.18), indicating a clear short-term uptrend. The MACD histogram is positive (0.049) and the MACD line (0.250) is above its signal line (0.201), confirming bullish momentum. Critically, in line with prioritizing momentum and volume, the current volume is an astonishing 723445.92x its average, signaling massive buying pressure and market interest. The AI Trend Analysis confidently (HIGH confidence) labels the trend as BULLISH, citing strong alignment across multiple indicators. While momentum oscillators like Stochastic K (79.9) and Williams %R (-20.1) are nearing overbought territory, in crypto's trending markets and an aggressive strategy, these levels still reflect powerful buying pressure rather than an immediate reversal, especially given the extreme volume. The absence of 1-hour data means we rely solely on these strong 5-minute signals and the high-confidence AI analysis.

Despite a short-term bearish MACD cross, multiple momentum indicators (Williams %R, Stochastic K) are deeply oversold, strongly suggesting an imminent upward reversal, which is a powerful BUY signal in crypto. The current price ($120.42) is holding above both the 20 and 50-period Simple Moving Averages ($120.36), further supporting bullish sentiment. Critically, current volume is extraordinarily high (34122.61x average), confirming strong market interest and potential for the predicted upward move. This aligns with the aggressive trading mandate to prioritize momentum and volume and accept higher risk for higher potential returns, especially as the current position is profitable and we are acting on an ""imminent upward reversal"".

While RSI is neutral (50.0) and MACD is flat (0.000), the overall context, especially the high volume and the AI's ""bullish MACD signal"" interpretation, supports a continuation of positive momentum. The AI also notes the price being above the upper Bollinger Band, which confirms strong upward pressure, though it can signal potential overextension; however, in aggressive crypto trading, strong momentum is prioritized. Crucially, the existing position of 1.384896 shares @ $577.66 is currently ""‚ùå UNPROFITABLE to sell"" after fees.
