However, critical short-term momentum indicators including RSI (67.2), Williams %R (-16.0), and Stochastic K (84.0) are all signaling overbought conditions, indicating a high risk of a near-term pullback. A crucial factor for the BALANCED TRADING MODE is the absence of 1-hour timeframe data. This prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and the necessary medium-term trend confirmation, which is a core requirement for high-confidence trades and capital preservation in this strategy. Without this critical longer-term alignment and given the overbought short-term conditions, initiating a new BUY position carries elevated risk and does not meet the strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicator demands of the balanced mode.

However, the short-term trend remains bearish, with the current price below both SMA 20 and SMA 50, and MACD lines in negative territory. A critical missing piece of information is the 1-hour timeframe data, which prevents essential medium-term trend confirmation and dual timeframe alignment. The AI analysis also categorizes the trend as \"NEUTRAL\" with a \"HIGH\" risk level. In \"BALANCED TRADING MODE,\" priority is given to capital preservation, requiring strong technical alignment across multiple timeframes, and avoiding trades during high volatility/risk periods. Despite the strong oversold signals, the absence of medium-term data, conflicting short-term trend indicators, and the high-risk assessment prevent a high-confidence trade. Therefore, it is prudent to hold and await clearer signals and critical medium-term trend confirmation.",

The AI Trend Analysis confirms a 'BEARISH' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence. While momentum oscillators like Williams %R (-81.8) and Stochastic K (18.2) suggest oversold conditions, potentially hinting at a short-term bounce, this is a counter-trend signal and not sufficient for a high-priority BUY. Crucially, 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, which prevents the essential dual-timeframe trend confirmation and alignment required for high-confidence trades in 'BALANCED TRADING MODE'. Without strong technical alignment across multiple timeframes and clear confirming bullish indicators (required for a technical score of 6+), initiating a BUY trade is not consistent with capital preservation and steady growth priorities.

The AI trend analysis confirms a BULLISH trend. However, multiple critical momentum indicators are signaling severely overbought conditions: RSI (14) at 79.3, Williams %R at -26.1, and Stochastic K at 73.9. The AI also highlights a HIGH risk level, specifically noting that these overbought conditions suggest a high probability of a near-term pullback or consolidation. As no 1-hour data is available, dual timeframe confirmation is absent, limiting confidence in a sustained strong trend. Under the BALANCED TRADING MODE, capital preservation is paramount. Entering a new long position when momentum indicators are so severely overbought and a pullback is anticipated would contradict the strategy's focus on avoiding high-risk trades and demanding multiple confirming indicators without conflict. With no current position, the prudent action is to HOLD and wait for a more favorable entry point following a potential consolidation or pullback.",

Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available. The \"Balanced Trading Mode\" explicitly mandates weighing 1-hour trends more heavily for direction and requires strong timeframe alignment for high-confidence trades. The absence of this critical medium-term data prevents a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and the necessary confirmation for a high-priority BUY. A technical score of 6+ is required for a high-priority BUY, which cannot be achieved due to the missing data and the overbought RSI.

While short-term momentum indicators such as RSI (11.9), Williams %R (-75.5), and Stochastic K (24.5) are deeply oversold, suggesting a potential for a short-term bounce, these do not constitute a reversal of the dominant bearish trend. Crucially, no 1-hour timeframe data is available, preventing the necessary dual-timeframe analysis and alignment required for high-confidence trades. The \"Balanced Trading Mode\" prioritizes capital preservation, demands multiple confirming indicators, and advises against trades during high volatility, which is currently present (high volume ratio, high ATR, high 20-day volatility). A BUY signal requires a technical score of 6+ and strong technical alignment, which is not met given the prevailing bearish trend and high risk.

However, this is heavily overshadowed by multiple strong indications of extremely overbought conditions: RSI (81.1), Williams %R (-16.4), and Stochastic K (83.6) are all well into overbought territory. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, explicitly stating the stock is \"extremely overbought\" and has a \"high likelihood of a short-term correction,\" assigning a \"HIGH\" risk level. Furthermore, the critical 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, which prevents dual-timeframe alignment and significantly reduces confidence for any high-priority trade as per the \"BALANCED TRADING MODE ACTIVE\" rules. There is no news data to provide an external catalyst. Initiating a BUY position under these overbought conditions, with a high risk of correction and missing medium-term confirmation, violates the capital preservation and strong technical alignment principles of the active trading mode.",

The AI trend analysis confirms a \"BEARISH\" trend with \"HIGH\" risk due to this overbought state, despite some underlying bullish signals from MACD and moving averages. Given the \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\" which prioritizes capital preservation, demands strong technical alignment (which is absent for a BUY due to conflicting overbought signals), and avoids high volatility, initiating a new BUY position at this overextended price point is too risky.

These oversold conditions suggest a potential short-term bounce. A critical limitation is the complete absence of 1-hour timeframe data, which prevents confirmation of the medium-term trend. The 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' mandates weighting 1-hour trends more heavily and achieving high confidence only when both timeframes agree. Given the conflicting short-term indicators and the lack of medium-term data for a cohesive trend, there is no strong technical alignment for either a BUY or SELL.

Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which makes it impossible to perform the required dual-timeframe analysis, a cornerstone of the Balanced Trading Mode. This absence of higher-timeframe confirmation significantly reduces the reliability of any short-term signals. The AI trend analysis confirms a BEARISH trend with LOW confidence and HIGH risk. Under the Balanced Trading Mode, which prioritizes capital preservation, demands multiple confirming indicators, and focuses on strong technical alignment across timeframes, a BUY action is not justified due to the bearish trend, conflicting signals, and critical lack of medium-term data.

The AI Trend Analysis confirms a 'BEARISH' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence.

As no 1-hour data is available, dual timeframe confirmation is absent, limiting confidence in a sustained strong trend. Under the BALANCED TRADING MODE, capital preservation is paramount.

The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, explicitly stating the stock is \"extremely overbought\" and has a \"high likelihood of a short-term correction,\" assigning a \"HIGH\" risk level.

The AI trend analysis confirms a BULLISH trend.

The AI also highlights a HIGH risk level, specifically noting that these overbought conditions suggest a high probability of a near-term pullback or consolidation. As no 1-hour data is available, dual timeframe confirmation is absent, limiting confidence in a sustained strong trend. Under the BALANCED TRADING MODE, capital preservation is paramount. Entering a new long position when momentum indicators are so severely overbought and a pullback is anticipated would contradict the strategy's focus on avoiding high-risk trades and demanding multiple confirming indicators without conflict.
