The price is currently trading below both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, and the MACD shows a clear bearish crossover with a negative histogram, indicating strong downward momentum. Furthermore, the exceptionally high volume (77,974,459) coupled with a negative price change reinforces the selling pressure. While Williams %R (-100.0) and Stochastic K (0.0) are showing extremely oversold conditions, the dominant bearish trend, as explicitly stated by the AI, currently outweighs these potential reversal signals. Based on these technicals, a SELL action would be indicated. However, our current position for BTCUSD is unprofitable (Net P&L: $-0.01) and does not meet the mandatory 2%+ stop-loss trigger. According to the critical fee-aware sell rules, we MUST recommend HOLD for an unprofitable position unless it triggers a stop-loss. Therefore, we will hold the existing position, prioritizing adherence to the profitability constraints while remaining vigilant for any shifts in trend or a return to profitability.
