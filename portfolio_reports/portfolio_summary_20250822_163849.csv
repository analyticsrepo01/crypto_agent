The absence of 1-hour timeframe data forces reliance solely on this perfectly flat 5-minute data. Despite a reported current volume of 5,000,000, the complete lack of price movement and volatility suggests this volume is not generating any actionable trend. According to Aggressive Trading Mode, a BUY requires a technical score of 4+ and a SELL requires 6-, neither of which is met by the current perfectly neutral signals.

While the AI trend analysis states ""LOW Confidence"" and ""largely flat,"" it still identifies the trend as ""BULLISH"" and notes a ""potential minor bounce"" from oversold conditions. Given the AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE, which prioritizes momentum and volume indicators and accepts higher risk for higher potential returns, this confluence of strong oversold signals, bullish price action relative to MAs, and explosive volume suggests an imminent upward move.
