The technical analysis for the 5-minute timeframe presents mixed signals. While the MACD shows a bullish crossover (MACD Line > Signal Line), indicating potential upward momentum, the price is currently trading below both the SMA 20 and SMA 50, and has a negative daily change (-0.10%). Key momentum indicators like RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic K are perfectly neutral at 50, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. Volume is exceptionally high, which can fuel a move in either direction. The AI's trend analysis confirms a NEUTRAL trend with MEDIUM confidence due to these conflicting signals and current consolidation. Crucially, 1-hour data for medium-term trend confirmation is unavailable, which significantly reduces the confidence for a decisive BUY or SELL action, especially given the instruction to weight 1-hour trends more heavily. With no strong bullish conviction (technical score not 4+), a constrained sell rule, and a neutral overall trend, holding the current position is the most prudent action.",2.0,LOW,NEUTRAL,MEDIUM,MEDIUM,50.0,107764.706,107762.5504,1.520239318061269,-0.10000201284080912,31349876.50836712,AGGRESSIVE

Despite the 5-minute technicals showing bearish signals (price consistently below SMA 20 and SMA 50, MACD indicating a bearish crossover with a negative histogram), and the AI Trend Analysis confirming a MEDIUM confidence BEARISH trend, the mandatory profitability constraint dictates holding the existing position.

Momentum indicators Williams %R (-96.1) and Stochastic K (3.9) are deeply oversold, signaling a high probability of a bullish reversal from the current flat consolidation. This is further supported by a bullish MACD crossover (MACD Line 0.003 > MACD Signal 0.000) and an exceptionally high volume spike (34245.11x average), indicating significant buying interest and confirming the AI's HIGH confidence BULLISH trend prediction. While these are strong signals for a BUY, the portfolio constraints prevent further action. We are currently holding 4.98629 shares, which is at the maximum limit of 5 shares per stock, thus preventing any new BUY orders. Furthermore, the existing position is currently unprofitable (Net P&L: $-0.48), and according to mandatory fee-aware sell rules, we are prohibited from selling at a loss unless a 2%+ stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here (current loss is only 0.083%).

The current price is trading above both SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating a short-term upward trend. Crucially, the current volume is exceptionally high (5,000,000x average), signaling strong market interest and momentum, which is prioritized in aggressive trading. While the MACD and RSI are currently neutral, the positive daily change supports the bullish sentiment. The AI trend analysis also identifies a BULLISH trend. Although the existing position is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L $-0.01), this rule strictly applies to SELLING the position. In aggressive mode, with strong bullish indicators, the strategy is to maximize profit by taking decisive action. Adding to the position increases exposure to the potential upside without violating the 'do not sell at a loss' rule for the existing shares. The lack of 1-hour data and the AI's conflicting detail about Bollinger Bands flagging as overbought (despite RSI 50) temper the confidence slightly, but the overall momentum and volume are too strong to ignore for an aggressive buy.",5.0,MEDIUM,BULLISH,LOW,HIGH,50.0,575.53,575.53,9.535060457526129e-09,0.37009365280697715,5000000.0,AGGRESSIVE
