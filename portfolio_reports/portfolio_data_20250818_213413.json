However, momentum indicators like RSI (67.2), Williams %R (-16.0), and Stochastic K (84.0) are indicating overbought conditions, suggesting potential for a short-term pullback or consolidation. Critically, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which is essential for conducting a comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and confirming the medium-term trend. The \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\" prioritizes capital preservation, demands multiple confirming indicators across *both* timeframes, and requires a technical score of 6+ for a high-priority BUY. Without 1-hour data, we cannot achieve the necessary dual-timeframe alignment or high confidence for a buy, especially with the 5-minute overbought signals posing a short-term risk. Therefore, waiting for more complete data or a clearer entry point after potential consolidation is prudent.",

      "reasoning": "While XOM exhibits extremely oversold conditions on the 5-minute timeframe (RSI 18.5, Williams %R -94.6, Stochastic K 5.4) suggesting a potential bounce, the stock remains in a short-term bearish trend with price below key moving averages (SMA 20, SMA 50) and bearish MACD signals. Crucially, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of the medium-term trend and contradicts the \"Weight 1-hour trends MORE heavily\" instruction. The AI trend analysis indicates \"NEUTRAL\" trend with \"LOW\" confidence and \"HIGH\" risk, explicitly stating \"Dual Timeframe: False\" and \"Timeframe Alignment: N/A\". The Balanced Trading Mode prioritizes capital preservation, requires strong technical alignment, demands multiple confirming indicators across timeframes, and advises avoiding trades during high volatility. The conflicting signals within the 5-minute timeframe (trend vs. momentum) and the complete absence of medium-term confirmation make this trade too speculative and high-risk for a balanced strategy.",

    "META": {
      "action": "HOLD",

      "reasoning": "The 5-minute timeframe analysis for META indicates a dominant bearish trend, with the current price trading below both the SMA 20 ($786.84) and SMA 50 ($787.59), and the MACD line being below its signal line with a negative histogram, confirming bearish momentum. The AI Trend Analysis also identifies a 'BEARISH' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence. However, counter-signals from Williams %R (-81.8) and Stochastic K (18.2) suggest oversold conditions, which could lead to a short-term bounce. This presents conflicting technical signals (bearish trend vs. oversold oscillators). Due to the absence of 1-hour timeframe data, dual-timeframe alignment cannot be confirmed, which is critical for high-confidence trades in BALANCED TRADING MODE. The strategy demands multiple confirming indicators and strong technical alignment, which is not present here given the conflicting trend and momentum indicators. Furthermore, no news data is available to act as a critical risk assessment factor or alignment. Given these factors, initiating a new position (either BUY or SELL) carries elevated risk and does not meet the criteria for a high-priority trade. A technical score of 4 is borderline for a high-priority SELL (requires 4-), but the oversold condition mitigates the immediate SELL opportunity, while the dominant bearish trend prevents a BUY. Holding is the most prudent action to preserve capital and await clearer technical alignment or a more favorable entry/exit point.",

However, key momentum oscillators, RSI (79.3) and Williams %R (-26.1), are severely overbought. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, indicating a bullish trend but explicitly stating that \"momentum indicators like RSI are showing overbought conditions, suggesting a potential short-term pullback.\" In Balanced Trading Mode, capital preservation is prioritized, and entering a new BUY trade when overbought conditions strongly suggest a potential pullback is contrary to this objective. Furthermore, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of the medium-term trend and dual-timeframe alignment. This significantly reduces confidence for initiating any high-priority trade, as it fails to meet the requirement for strong technical alignment across multiple timeframes. Therefore, despite the short-term bullish trend, the high risk of a pullback due to overbought conditions and the lack of longer-term confirmation warrant a HOLD to wait for a clearer entry point or a correction.",

However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently in overbought territory at 72.9, which suggests a potential for a near-term price pullback or consolidation. Crucially, the 1-hour timeframe data is unavailable, which prevents the required comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and the confirmation of the medium-term trend. Under the BALANCED TRADING MODE, capital preservation is prioritized, and trades require multiple confirming indicators and strong technical alignment across timeframes. Initiating a new buy position without the critical 1-hour trend confirmation and with short-term overbought conditions presents an elevated risk that does not align with the strategy's cautious approach.

The absence of 1-hour timeframe data is critical, as it prevents comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and the confirmation of a medium-term trend, which is required for high-confidence trades in BALANCED TRADING MODE. The conflicting signals (bearish trend vs. oversold bounce) do not provide the multiple confirming indicators demanded by the strategy for a BUY. Furthermore, the extremely high volume ratio (2,458,408x average) suggests high volatility, which should be avoided for new trades. Given the priority on capital preservation, the lack of strong technical alignment for a BUY, and the missing crucial 1-hour data, holding is the prudent action.",

The AI trend analysis also highlights a \"HIGH Risk Level\" and suggests a high probability of a short-term pullback due to these overbought levels. Crucially, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents the required dual-timeframe analysis for strong technical alignment and high-confidence trades as per the balanced trading mode. Capital preservation is prioritized, and trades are avoided during high volatility. Given the conflicting signals (bullish trend vs. extreme overbought and high risk of pullback) and the lack of a confirming longer timeframe, it is prudent to refrain from initiating a position and wait for clearer signals or a price correction.

The AI Trend Analysis explicitly flags TSLA as BEARISH with MEDIUM confidence and HIGH risk due to these overbought conditions. Critically, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents dual-timeframe analysis and confirmation, severely limiting confidence in any directional trade. The \"Balanced Trading Mode\" prioritizes capital preservation and demands strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators, as well as avoiding high volatility periods. Given the conflicting signals (immediate upward momentum vs. severe overbought, suggesting reversal) and the absence of a crucial longer-term timeframe for confirmation, the conditions for a high-priority BUY are not met.

This suggests the current downtrend may be exhausting or due for a short-term bounce. The AI trend analysis is \"BEARISH\" but with \"LOW\" confidence, specifically citing these conflicting signals. Furthermore, the volume ratio is extremely high, indicating significant, potentially volatile, activity. Under BALANCED TRADING MODE, which prioritizes capital preservation, demands multiple confirming indicators, and avoids trades during high volatility, initiating a new BUY position is not advisable due to the lack of clear, aligned bullish confirmation across multiple indicators and timeframes. A technical score of 6+ is required for high-priority BUY, which is not met here given the mixed signals and underlying bearish trend.

This bearish trend is further confirmed by the AI trend analysis. However, multiple momentum indicators, including RSI (22.7), Williams %R (-81.1), and Stochastic K (18.9), are all deeply in oversold territory. This suggests the potential for a short-term rebound or consolidation, creating a conflict with the established downtrend. Critically, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents comprehensive dual-timeframe analysis and the necessary medium-term trend confirmation that the balanced trading mode prioritizes. Without alignment across timeframes and with conflicting short-term technical signals, initiating a trade would violate the strategy's demand for multiple confirming indicators and strong technical alignment, and contradict the focus on capital preservation.",

The Balanced Trading Mode prioritizes capital preservation, requires strong technical alignment, demands multiple confirming indicators across timeframes, and advises avoiding trades during high volatility.

The AI Trend Analysis also identifies a 'BEARISH' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence. However, counter-signals from Williams %R (-81.8) and Stochastic K (18.2) suggest oversold conditions, which could lead to a short-term bounce. This presents conflicting technical signals (bearish trend vs. oversold oscillators). Due to the absence of 1-hour timeframe data, dual-timeframe alignment cannot be confirmed, which is critical for high-confidence trades in BALANCED TRADING MODE. The strategy demands multiple confirming indicators and strong technical alignment, which is not present here given the conflicting trend and momentum indicators. Furthermore, no news data is available to act as a critical risk assessment factor or alignment. Given these factors, initiating a new position (either BUY or SELL) carries elevated risk and does not meet the criteria for a high-priority trade. A technical score of 4 is borderline for a high-priority SELL (requires 4-), but the oversold condition mitigates the immediate SELL opportunity, while the dominant bearish trend prevents a BUY.

The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, indicating a bullish trend but explicitly stating that \"momentum indicators like RSI are showing overbought conditions, suggesting a potential short-term pullback.\" In Balanced Trading Mode, capital preservation is prioritized, and entering a new BUY trade when overbought conditions strongly suggest a potential pullback is contrary to this objective. Furthermore, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of the medium-term trend and dual-timeframe alignment. This significantly reduces confidence for initiating any high-priority trade, as it fails to meet the requirement for strong technical alignment across multiple timeframes.

The AI Trend Analysis also identifies a 'BEARISH' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence. However, counter-signals from Williams %R (-81.8) and Stochastic K (18.2) suggest oversold conditions, which could lead to a short-term bounce. This presents conflicting technical signals (bearish trend vs. oversold oscillators). Due to the absence of 1-hour timeframe data, dual-timeframe alignment cannot be confirmed, which is critical for high-confidence trades in BALANCED TRADING MODE. The strategy demands multiple confirming indicators and strong technical alignment, which is not present here given the conflicting trend and momentum indicators. Furthermore, no news data is available to act as a critical risk assessment factor or alignment. Given these factors, initiating a new position (either BUY or SELL) carries elevated risk and does not meet the criteria for a high-priority trade. A technical score of 4 is borderline for a high-priority SELL (requires 4-), but the oversold condition mitigates the immediate SELL opportunity, while the dominant bearish trend prevents a BUY.

The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this, indicating a bullish trend but explicitly stating that \"momentum indicators like RSI are showing overbought conditions, suggesting a potential short-term pullback.\" In Balanced Trading Mode, capital preservation is prioritized, and entering a new BUY trade when overbought conditions strongly suggest a potential pullback is contrary to this objective. Furthermore, there is no 1-hour timeframe data available, which prevents confirmation of the medium-term trend and dual-timeframe alignment. This significantly reduces confidence for initiating any high-priority trade, as it fails to meet the requirement for strong technical alignment across multiple timeframes.
