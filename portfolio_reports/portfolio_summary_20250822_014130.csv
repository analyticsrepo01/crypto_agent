This suggests a high probability of a short-term pullback or consolidation, despite the underlying bullish bias. In aggressive trading mode, while we seek high returns, entering a BUY at a point where immediate momentum indicators are flashing bearish/overbought signals for a potential pullback is not a decisive entry for maximizing *immediate* profit, as it risks absorbing short-term losses.
