Per the CRITICAL FEE-AWARE SELL RULES, a position must not be sold at a loss unless it's an emergency stop-loss trigger (2%+ loss). The current price of $107700.02 is above the calculated 2% stop-loss trigger of $105645.04.

In an aggressive trading mode, and as highlighted by the AI Trend Analysis, these extreme oversold levels in crypto are stronger signals and ""strongly suggest an imminent bullish bounce or reversal from the current static price."" This potential reversal is further supported by an exceptionally high current volume (712685.64x average), indicating significant market interest that could fuel a swift upward movement. The lack of 1-hour data reduces confidence in the medium-term trend, but the confluence of extreme oversold signals with high volume presents a high-potential, high-risk entry for an aggressive trader seeking to maximize profit from an anticipated bounce. The existing position is currently unprofitable to sell (Net P&L After Fees: $-1.26), so we will not be selling current shares, but initiating a new BUY order to capitalize on the expected bounce.",5.0,MEDIUM,BEARISH,LOW,HIGH,40.032154340835255,2482.5495,2482.2268,-0.322786353847484,0.0,712685.6403406371,AGGRESSIVE

The current price ($120.42) is trading above both the SMA 20 ($120.35) and SMA 50 ($120.36), signaling an uptrend. MACD shows bullish momentum with a positive histogram (0.002) and the MACD line above its signal line. Volume is exceptionally high (33860x average), providing strong confirmation for the bullish price action. While RSI (54.5) is neutral, the AI interprets the oversold Williams %R and Stochastic K indicators, coupled with positive price change, as suggesting a strong potential for continued upward movement. The current position is profitable with a net P&L of +$0.11, making it eligible for a sell. However, in an AGGRESSIVE TRADING MODE focused on maximizing profit and accepting higher risk, selling a strongly bullish and profitable position would be counter-productive to potential further gains. Although the current holding of 5.4015 shares slightly exceeds the ""Max shares per stock: 5"" constraint, the overwhelming bullish technical signals and the profitable status justify holding the position to capitalize on the confirmed uptrend. This aligns with the strategy to be quick to enter/exit based on signals (which are currently bullish) and prioritize momentum and volume for maximizing profit.",8.0,HIGH,BULLISH,HIGH,MEDIUM,54.54545454545455,120.348,120.36,0.001606640610227742,0.0997506234414003,33860.2700272866,AGGRESSIVE

Technical analysis for the 5-minute timeframe shows the price above the SMA 20 and SMA 50, indicating short-term bullish sentiment, and high current volume is positive.
