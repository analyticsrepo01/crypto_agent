This increases the risk of a short-term pullback or consolidation, making it an unfavorable entry point for a balanced strategy prioritizing capital preservation. Furthermore, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents critical dual-timeframe trend confirmation, reducing confidence in the overall signal.
