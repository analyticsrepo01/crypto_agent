      "reasoning": "The analysis for AAPL reveals a highly mixed and predominantly neutral technical picture, lacking the strong alignment required for a high-priority trade under the Balanced Trading Mode. While the MACD indicates a very slight bullish crossover, the price remains below key moving averages (SMA 20/50, EMA 12/26), which the AI trend analysis identifies as being in a bearish alignment. Momentum indicators like RSI and Stochastic are in neutral territory, and Bollinger Bands suggest low volatility with the price hovering around the middle band. The AI's 'BULLISH' trend confidence is low, and its reasoning points to a \"very weak, sideways trend.\" Given the absence of strong, confirming technical indicators (not meeting the 6+ for BUY or 4- for SELL requirement), the strategy's emphasis on capital preservation, and the lack of news sentiment, a trade is not justified. Furthermore, attempting to BUY would violate the minimum cash reserve constraint. Therefore, holding the current position is the most prudent action.",

      "action": "HOLD",
      "priority": "LOW",
      "reasoning": "The primary reason for a HOLD decision is insufficient available cash ($239.54) to purchase 1 share of META at its current price ($765.72), making a BUY order impossible under current portfolio constraints. Furthermore, the technical analysis presents a mixed picture that does not meet the \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\" requirements for a BUY. While there are some short-term bullish signals (MACD bullish cross, RSI at 62.8 indicating momentum, price slightly above SMA 20 and EMA 12, and above Bollinger Band middle), these are tempered by the price remaining below longer-term moving averages (SMA 50 and EMA 26) and a slight bearish Stochastic K/D cross. Crucially, the AI Trend Analysis indicates a \"BULLISH\" trend with \"LOW\" confidence and highlights \"strong underlying bearish trend indicators\" (such as ADX and Parabolic SAR). This lack of strong, confirming technical alignment and the presence of significant underlying bearish signals are not consistent with the strategy's demand for \"strong technical alignment\" and a \"technical score 6+\" for a high-priority BUY. No strong SELL signal is present.",

    "AMZN": {
      "action": "HOLD",
      "priority": "LOW",
      "reasoning": "The technical analysis for AMZN indicates a strong consolidation phase, with the AI trend analysis confidently labeling the trend as \"NEUTRAL\" due to an extremely low ADX and price tightly hugging key moving averages (SMA 20, SMA 50, EMA 12, EMA 26) and the Bollinger Band middle line. While MACD shows a minor bullish cross, its histogram and line values are extremely small, suggesting very weak upward momentum that is not confirmed by other indicators. RSI (62.2) is mildly bullish but not strongly directional. Stochastic indicators are mixed, and Williams %R is neutral. There is no news sentiment available, so it does not contribute to the decision. In 'BALANCED TRADING MODE', capital preservation is prioritized, demanding technical scores of 6+ for high-priority BUY and 4- for high-priority SELL, along with multiple confirming indicators. The current technical signals for AMZN are overwhelmingly neutral or very weak, falling well short of these thresholds and lacking the strong alignment required for a trade. Therefore, a HOLD decision is appropriate to avoid trading during a period of indecision and lack of clear directional momentum.",

    "NFLX": {
      "action": "HOLD",

      "reasoning": "The technical indicators present a mixed to weakly bearish picture. The MACD shows a bearish crossover (MACD Line 0.103 below Signal 0.744) with a negative histogram (-0.641), indicating bearish momentum. The current price ($1241.95) is also below the SMA 20 ($1244.25) and EMA 12 ($1242.82), suggesting short-term weakness. The AI trend analysis corroborates a BEARISH trend, though with LOW confidence. Momentum indicators like RSI (45.6), Williams %R (-66.1), and Stochastic K/D (33.9/32.2) are largely neutral, not providing strong confirming signals for either direction. Given the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' requirement for 'multiple confirming indicators' and 'strong technical alignment' for high-priority trades, the current technical setup does not meet the criteria for a high-conviction BUY or SELL. No news data is available, so it does not influence the decision. Critically, with NFLX's current price of $1241.95, the available cash of $239.54 (leaving $149.54 after min reserve) is insufficient to execute a BUY order. As there are 0 shares currently held, a SELL order is also not possible. Therefore, despite the weak bearish technical leaning, financial and positional constraints dictate a HOLD action.",

Technically, the stock presents mixed signals: while momentum indicators such as MACD and Stochastic show bullish crossovers suggesting a potential short-term rebound from weak levels, the price remains below key moving averages (SMA 20, SMA 50, EMA 12, EMA 26) and RSI is weak (33.5), indicating an underlying downtrend. There is no strong technical alignment or multiple confirming indicators for a high-priority BUY signal (technical score is well below the required 6+), nor a high-priority SELL signal (no current position). Volume data is unavailable, which limits comprehensive analysis. Given the 'Balanced Trading Mode's' emphasis on capital preservation, strong technical alignment, and the current portfolio constraints, holding is the only viable action.",

The MACD histogram is negative (-0.045), and the MACD line (0.037) has crossed below its signal line (0.082), signaling strong bearish momentum. The current price ($181.38) is trading below key short-term moving averages (SMA 20 at $181.58, EMA 12 at $181.47, and EMA 26 at $181.44), and also below the Bollinger Middle Band ($181.58), reinforcing a downward short-term bias. The Stochastic K (55.8) is below Stochastic D (65.2), indicating weakening upward momentum and a potential bearish crossover. Furthermore, the AI Trend Analysis provides a \"BEARISH\" assessment with \"HIGH\" confidence, explicitly stating that multiple key indicators confirm negative price momentum. These multiple confirming bearish indicators provide strong technical alignment for a SELL action. While the portfolio currently holds 0 shares of NVDA, preventing an immediate execution of a SELL order, and available cash ($239.54) is insufficient to initiate a BUY position while maintaining the minimum cash reserve, the technical analysis unequivocally points to a strong bearish outlook.",

      "reasoning": "Technical indicators for TSLA present mixed signals, indicating a period of consolidation with short-term bearish momentum against a stated underlying uptrend. MACD and Stochastic show bearish crossovers, and the price is hovering around its short-term moving averages (SMA 20, EMA 12) and slightly below its previous close. However, the AI trend analysis notes a \"strong underlying uptrend\" despite short-term bearish pressure, and the price remains above longer-term averages (SMA 50, EMA 26). Crucially, volume data is missing, which prevents confirmation of any potential price movements. Given the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE's' emphasis on capital preservation, requiring strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators, the conflicting signals do not support a high-priority BUY (score 6+) or a high-priority SELL (score 4-). The lack of clear direction and missing data necessitate a cautious HOLD to monitor for clearer technical alignment.",

From a technical perspective, momentum indicators (Stochastic K: 73.7, Williams %R: -26.3) suggest overbought conditions, hinting at potential downside, and the AI trend analysis indicates a BEARISH bias with medium confidence. However, other indicators like RSI (53.1) are neutral, and price action is flat around key moving averages, suggesting consolidation rather than a strong directional trend. Volume data is also unreliable (-1). Given the \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\" that demands strong technical alignment and multiple confirming indicators, the mixed technical signals do not present a high-priority BUY or SELL opportunity even if portfolio constraints allowed. Due to portfolio constraints and the absence of clear, strong technical conviction for either direction, holding is the appropriate action.",

Momentum indicators like RSI and Stochastic are in neutral territory, and Bollinger Bands suggest low volatility with the price hovering around the middle band.

While there are some short-term bullish signals (MACD bullish cross, RSI at 62.8 indicating momentum, price slightly above SMA 20 and EMA 12, and above Bollinger Band middle), these are tempered by the price remaining below longer-term moving averages (SMA 50 and EMA 26) and a slight bearish Stochastic K/D cross. Crucially, the AI Trend Analysis indicates a \"BULLISH\" trend with \"LOW\" confidence and highlights \"strong underlying bearish trend indicators\" (such as ADX and Parabolic SAR). This lack of strong, confirming technical alignment and the presence of significant underlying bearish signals are not consistent with the strategy's demand for \"strong technical alignment\" and a \"technical score 6+\" for a high-priority BUY.

While MACD shows a minor bullish cross, its histogram and line values are extremely small, suggesting very weak upward momentum that is not confirmed by other indicators. RSI (62.2) is mildly bullish but not strongly directional. Stochastic indicators are mixed, and Williams %R is neutral. There is no news sentiment available, so it does not contribute to the decision. In 'BALANCED TRADING MODE', capital preservation is prioritized, demanding technical scores of 6+ for high-priority BUY and 4- for high-priority SELL, along with multiple confirming indicators. The current technical signals for AMZN are overwhelmingly neutral or very weak, falling well short of these thresholds and lacking the strong alignment required for a trade.

The current price ($1241.95) is also below the SMA 20 ($1244.25) and EMA 12 ($1242.82), suggesting short-term weakness. The AI trend analysis corroborates a BEARISH trend, though with LOW confidence.

Given the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' requirement for 'multiple confirming indicators' and 'strong technical alignment' for high-priority trades, the current technical setup does not meet the criteria for a high-conviction BUY or SELL. No news data is available, so it does not influence the decision. Critically, with NFLX's current price of $1241.95, the available cash of $239.54 (leaving $149.54 after min reserve) is insufficient to execute a BUY order. As there are 0 shares currently held, a SELL order is also not possible. Therefore, despite the weak bearish technical leaning, financial and positional constraints dictate a HOLD action.",

The current price ($181.38) is trading below key short-term moving averages (SMA 20 at $181.58, EMA 12 at $181.47, and EMA 26 at $181.44), and also below the Bollinger Middle Band ($181.58), reinforcing a downward short-term bias. The Stochastic K (55.8) is below Stochastic D (65.2), indicating weakening upward momentum and a potential bearish crossover. Furthermore, the AI Trend Analysis provides a \"BEARISH\" assessment with \"HIGH\" confidence, explicitly stating that multiple key indicators confirm negative price momentum. These multiple confirming bearish indicators provide strong technical alignment for a SELL action. While the portfolio currently holds 0 shares of NVDA, preventing an immediate execution of a SELL order, and available cash ($239.54) is insufficient to initiate a BUY position while maintaining the minimum cash reserve, the technical analysis unequivocally points to a strong bearish outlook.",

However, the AI trend analysis notes a \"strong underlying uptrend\" despite short-term bearish pressure, and the price remains above longer-term averages (SMA 50, EMA 26). Crucially, volume data is missing, which prevents confirmation of any potential price movements.

Momentum indicators like RSI and Stochastic are in neutral territory, and Bollinger Bands suggest low volatility with the price hovering around the middle band. The AI's 'BULLISH' trend confidence is low, and its reasoning points to a \"very weak, sideways trend.\" Given the absence of strong, confirming technical indicators (not meeting the 6+ for BUY or 4- for SELL requirement), the strategy's emphasis on capital preservation, and the lack of news sentiment, a trade is not justified.

Furthermore, the technical analysis presents a mixed picture that does not meet the \"BALANCED TRADING MODE\" requirements for a BUY. While there are some short-term bullish signals (MACD bullish cross, RSI at 62.8 indicating momentum, price slightly above SMA 20 and EMA 12, and above Bollinger Band middle), these are tempered by the price remaining below longer-term moving averages (SMA 50 and EMA 26) and a slight bearish Stochastic K/D cross. Crucially, the AI Trend Analysis indicates a \"BULLISH\" trend with \"LOW\" confidence and highlights \"strong underlying bearish trend indicators\" (such as ADX and Parabolic SAR). This lack of strong, confirming technical alignment and the presence of significant underlying bearish signals are not consistent with the strategy's demand for \"strong technical alignment\" and a \"technical score 6+\" for a high-priority BUY.

While MACD shows a minor bullish cross, its histogram and line values are extremely small, suggesting very weak upward momentum that is not confirmed by other indicators. RSI (62.2) is mildly bullish but not strongly directional. Stochastic indicators are mixed, and Williams %R is neutral. There is no news sentiment available, so it does not contribute to the decision. In 'BALANCED TRADING MODE', capital preservation is prioritized, demanding technical scores of 6+ for high-priority BUY and 4- for high-priority SELL, along with multiple confirming indicators. The current technical signals for AMZN are overwhelmingly neutral or very weak, falling well short of these thresholds and lacking the strong alignment required for a trade.

The current price ($1241.95) is also below the SMA 20 ($1244.25) and EMA 12 ($1242.82), suggesting short-term weakness. The AI trend analysis corroborates a BEARISH trend, though with LOW confidence.

Given the 'BALANCED TRADING MODE' requirement for 'multiple confirming indicators' and 'strong technical alignment' for high-priority trades, the current technical setup does not meet the criteria for a high-conviction BUY or SELL. No news data is available, so it does not influence the decision. Critically, with NFLX's current price of $1241.95, the available cash of $239.54 (leaving $149.54 after min reserve) is insufficient to execute a BUY order.

There is no strong technical alignment or multiple confirming indicators for a high-priority BUY signal (technical score is well below the required 6+), nor a high-priority SELL signal (no current position).

The current price ($181.38) is trading below key short-term moving averages (SMA 20 at $181.58, EMA 12 at $181.47, and EMA 26 at $181.44), and also below the Bollinger Middle Band ($181.58), reinforcing a downward short-term bias. The Stochastic K (55.8) is below Stochastic D (65.2), indicating weakening upward momentum and a potential bearish crossover. Furthermore, the AI Trend Analysis provides a \"BEARISH\" assessment with \"HIGH\" confidence, explicitly stating that multiple key indicators confirm negative price momentum. These multiple confirming bearish indicators provide strong technical alignment for a SELL action. While the portfolio currently holds 0 shares of NVDA, preventing an immediate execution of a SELL order, and available cash ($239.54) is insufficient to initiate a BUY position while maintaining the minimum cash reserve, the technical analysis unequivocally points to a strong bearish outlook.",

However, the AI trend analysis notes a \"strong underlying uptrend\" despite short-term bearish pressure, and the price remains above longer-term averages (SMA 50, EMA 26).

Volume data is also unreliable (-1).
