Crucially, the current volume of 5,000,000 is extraordinarily high compared to the average (5,000,000x), signaling extremely strong positive momentum, which is prioritized in aggressive trading mode. While the AI notes the price is above the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting an overbought condition and potential for a pullback, the RSI is a neutral 50, not indicating extreme overbought levels (>80). Given the aggressive trading mode, the overwhelming volume and bullish trend provide a strong technical signal (Technical Score 6, actionable for BUY). We accept the higher risk for potential higher returns by riding this strong momentum. The current position is unprofitable to sell, so we are holding it, but this BUY action aims to capitalize on current momentum to potentially make the overall position profitable.",N/A,577.66,50.0,sim_1755699287,Submitted,0.086556,0,0,0.000221,0.0,950.0,1
