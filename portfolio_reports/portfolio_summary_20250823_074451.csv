This is strongly confirmed by a bullish MACD, with the MACD Line (14.590) above its Signal Line (8.713) and a positive MACD Histogram (5.877). While the price is currently below the 20 and 50 SMAs, and the daily change is slightly negative, these are short-term bearish indications. Given the overwhelming momentum from volume and the bullish MACD, this suggests a potential short-term dip presenting an aggressive entry point before a likely upward move. The technical score of 7, derived from these strong bullish indicators outweighing the minor bearish ones, comfortably exceeds the ""4+"" threshold for a BUY action. No news is available, so the decision is purely based on strong technical signals.

The MACD shows a bullish crossover with a positive and increasing histogram (0.079), indicating strong upward momentum. The price ($2482.93) is decisively above both the SMA 20 ($2481.93) and SMA 50 ($2482.13), further confirming a short-term uptrend. Momentum indicators like Williams %R (-20.1) and Stochastic K (79.9) are strongly bullish, with Stochastic K nearing overbought territory, which in crypto is often a sign of strong buying pressure rather than an immediate reversal, especially in trending markets. The current volume of 77,452,776 is exceptionally high relative to the Volume MA, signaling significant buying interest and validating the price movement, aligning with the aggressive trading mode's emphasis on volume. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this with a ""BULLISH"" trend and ""HIGH"" confidence. Although no 1-hour data is available, the robust 5-minute signals provide sufficient conviction, and the aggressive trading mode dictates capitalizing on strong momentum. While the current position is unprofitable to sell, the overwhelming bullish technicals and active aggressive trading mode necessitate a new BUY action to maximize profit potential by adding to the position and leveraging the strong upward trend.
