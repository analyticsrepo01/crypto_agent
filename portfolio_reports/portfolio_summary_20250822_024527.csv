Furthermore, momentum indicators like Williams %R (-20.0) and Stochastic K (80.0) are deep into overbought territory, strongly suggesting a potential pullback or correction. While the MACD shows a bullish crossover and positive histogram, this bullish signal is significantly contradicted by the broader bearish sentiment from price action, moving averages, and the overbought conditions of other key momentum indicators. The extremely high volume confirms the current price movement. With no 1-hour data for medium-term trend confirmation and conflicting signals with an overall bearish bias, entering a new long position would entail high risk and does not meet the ""BUY technical scores 4+"" threshold.

For potential new aggressive trades, the overall market for ETHUSD shows extreme stagnation with a 0.00% daily price change, despite extremely high current volume (76,935,621 vs MA of 110). This high volume without price movement indicates balanced buying and selling pressure rather than clear directional momentum. Technical indicators are conflicting: MACD components are bearish (histogram -0.063, MACD line -0.173 below signal -0.110), while the current price ($2482.92) is slightly above the SMA 20 and SMA 50 ($2481.93).
