The 5-minute MACD shows a clear bearish signal with the MACD line (-5.924) below the signal line (-3.491) and a negative histogram (-2.432), which is considered a more reliable signal in crypto markets. Although the market exhibits extreme flatness (0.00% daily change) and other indicators like RSI and Stochastic are neutral, the presence of a bearish MACD combined with a profitable position warrants immediate action under the aggressive trading mode. The extremely high volume ratio (31693899.28x average) without price movement suggests indecision or potential distribution, and the lack of 1-hour data prevents confirmation of any stronger bullish trend.
