A robust bullish MACD crossover is evident, with the MACD line well above its signal line and a positive, increasing histogram, indicating accelerating upward momentum. Crucially, this upward movement is supported by exceptionally high current volume. Although short-term oscillators like RSI, Williams %R, and Stochastic K are currently neutral at 50, the primary trend and momentum indicators are unequivocally bullish. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates this with a HIGH confidence BULLISH assessment.
