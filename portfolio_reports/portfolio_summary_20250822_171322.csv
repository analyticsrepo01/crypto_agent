Although the MACD shows a slight bearish bias, the overwhelming evidence from the extreme oversold momentum indicators combined with massive volume and a positive daily price change points towards a high-probability bullish reversal. The AI trend analysis also categorizes the outlook as BULLISH based on these factors.
