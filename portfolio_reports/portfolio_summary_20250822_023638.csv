This negative sentiment is further supported by high volume, which the AI attributes to confirming negative daily change and negative OBV pressure. Momentum oscillators like Stochastic K (80.0) and Williams %R (-20.0) are in overbought territory, signaling potential exhaustion of any short-term bullish moves and a likely reversal. Although MACD shows a bullish crossover, under aggressive trading mode and considering the AI's comprehensive, integrated assessment which acknowledges the MACD but still concludes bearish due to stronger trend and volume confirmation of negative price action, a short position is warranted.
