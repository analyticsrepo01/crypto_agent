Per this critical rule, I MUST recommend HOLD unless a 2%+ stop-loss is triggered, which is not the case here. Despite this enforced HOLD, the technical outlook for BTCUSD is strongly bearish based on the 5-minute timeframe. Price is consistently below both SMA20 ($107748.53) and SMA50 ($107756.08), and these moving averages are bearishly aligned (SMA20 < SMA50). Momentum indicators reinforce this bearish bias: MACD Histogram is negative (-2.074), and a clear bearish MACD crossover is present (MACD Line -0.044 is below MACD Signal 2.030), which is considered reliable in crypto markets. Volume is exceptionally high (21538544.21x average), confirming strong participation in the current bearish momentum. The AI Trend Analysis corroborates a 'BEARISH' trend with 'MEDIUM' confidence.
