The AI trend analysis, though bullish, also highlights this risk of a short-term pullback. The extremely high volume ratio indicates significant activity and potential high volatility, which conflicts with the 'avoid trades during high volatility periods' directive of the Balanced Trading Mode. No 1-hour data is available for medium-term trend confirmation, reducing overall confidence. Given these mixed signals, particularly the overbought conditions and high volatility, initiating a new BUY order is not advisable under the current balanced strategy focused on capital preservation and requiring strong alignment.
