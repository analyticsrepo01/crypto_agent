This suggests the current upward move is extended and a pullback or consolidation is highly probable. The ""BALANCED TRADING MODE"" prioritizes capital preservation and demands multiple confirming indicators; here, the overbought momentum signals directly conflict with a new BUY entry. Furthermore, the absence of 1-hour timeframe data prevents a higher-level trend confirmation, reducing overall confidence and alignment required for a high-priority trade. The extremely high volume ratio, while not definitive on its own, could indicate elevated volatility, which the balanced mode aims to avoid for new entries.
