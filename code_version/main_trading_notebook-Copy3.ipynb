      "\n",
      "**STOCK: AAPL | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: LOW | REASONING: Technical Score is 7.0 (above SELL threshold 6-) and AI Trend is BULLISH. While MACD Histogram is negative and volume is low, RSI (66.3) indicates positive momentum. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 7.0 | CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM**\n",
      "\n",
      "**STOCK: XOM | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: LOW | REASONING: Technical Score of 1/10 (STRONG_BEARISH) and negative MACD Histogram (-0.011) indicate a strong bearish trend. No position held, thus no action. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 1.0 | CONFIDENCE: HIGH**\n",
      "\n",
      "**STOCK: META | ACTION: SELL | PRIORITY: HIGH | REASONING: Extremely overbought RSI (77.5) and price at Upper Bollinger Band suggest an overextended move. Despite a bullish score (7.0), aggressive profit-taking is warranted to maximize returns by exiting potential reversals. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 7.0 | CONFIDENCE: HIGH**\n",
      "\n",
      "**STOCK: AMZN | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: LOW | REASONING: Technical Score is 7.5 (above BUY threshold 4+) and AI Trend is BULLISH. While MACD Histogram is negative and RSI is neutral, the current position (9 shares) and trade size (10 shares per order) prevent adding more without exceeding max shares (15). | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 7.5 | CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM**\n",
      "\n",
      "**STOCK: NFLX | ACTION: SELL | PRIORITY: HIGH | REASONING: Extremely overbought RSI (82.8) signals high risk of a pullback.

      "\n",
      "**STOCK: MSFT | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: MEDIUM | REASONING: Technical Score is 7.5 (above BUY threshold 4+) and indicators like RSI (58.2) and MACD Histogram (0.372) show healthy bullish momentum without being overextended. Current position (9 shares) prevents adding more due to trade size exceeding max shares. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 7.5 | CONFIDENCE: HIGH**\n",
      "\n",
      "**STOCK: NVDA | ACTION: SELL | PRIORITY: HIGH | REASONING: Technical Score of 3/10 (WEAK_BEARISH) is a clear SELL signal (<= 6). The negative MACD Histogram (-0.191) confirms bearish momentum, justifying an aggressive exit to minimize risk. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 3.0 | CONFIDENCE: HIGH**\n",

      "**STOCK: TSLA | ACTION: BUY | PRIORITY: HIGH | REASONING: Technical Score 10/10 (STRONG_BULLISH) combined with strong bullish momentum indicated by RSI (63.1) and positive MACD Histogram (0.316). This aligns with aggressive strategy to maximize profit on strong trends. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 10.0 | CONFIDENCE: HIGH**\n",

      "STOCK: AAPL | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: LOW | REASONING: Technical score is bullish (7/10), but negative MACD histogram and low volume limit conviction for an aggressive buy.

      "STOCK: XOM | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: LOW | REASONING: While the technical score is actionable for BUY (5/10), momentum indicators like RSI (32.9) and MACD histogram (0.010) are not strongly bullish. The AI trend is neutral with low confidence, not supporting an aggressive entry. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 5 | CONFIDENCE: LOW\n",
      "STOCK: META | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: LOW | REASONING: Strong MACD histogram (1.150) and bullish technical score (7/10) indicate momentum, but RSI (79.9) is extremely overbought and price is at the upper Bollinger band, posing high risk. Position is 6 shares, and buying 10 would exceed the 15-share maximum. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 7 | CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM\n",
      "STOCK: AMZN | ACTION: SELL | PRIORITY: HIGH | REASONING: Strong bearish technical score (3/10) with a negative MACD histogram (-0.260) and bearish AI trend (medium confidence) indicate significant downside momentum.

      "STOCK: NFLX | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: LOW | REASONING: Bullish technical score (7/10) and positive MACD histogram (0.564) show momentum, but the RSI is extremely overbought (80.0), signaling high risk for further upside without a correction. Prioritizing cleaner setups for aggressive buys. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 7.0 | CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM\n",
      "STOCK: MSFT | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: LOW | REASONING: Excellent technical score (8.5/10) with a healthy RSI (57.0) and high confidence bullish AI trend. However, current position is 9 shares, and buying 10 more would exceed the 15-share maximum per stock, preventing an actionable order. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 8.5 | CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM\n",
      "STOCK: NVDA | ACTION: SELL | PRIORITY: HIGH | REASONING: Very strong bearish technical score (2/10) confirmed by a negative MACD histogram (-0.194) and high confidence bearish AI trend. This signals a clear downtrend, demanding an aggressive exit. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 2 | CONFIDENCE: HIGH\n",
      "STOCK: TSLA | ACTION: BUY | PRIORITY: HIGH | REASONING: Exceptional technical score (10/10) with a healthy RSI (61.8), positive MACD histogram (0.250), and high confidence bullish AI trend indicate very strong upside momentum. This aligns perfectly with aggressive buying criteria and adheres to constraints. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 10 | CONFIDENCE: HIGH\n",
