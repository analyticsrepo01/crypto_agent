      "STOCK: GOOGL | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: LOW | REASONING: Position is long with a medium-confidence bullish AI trend. However, RSI is overbought (73.2), presenting conflicting signals. Holding is prudent given the mixed outlook for capital preservation. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 6\n",

However, the AI trend is BULLISH (MEDIUM), creating conflicting signals. Holding to observe further developments and prioritize capital preservation by not adding to a short position against a bullish AI trend. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 6\n",
      "STOCK: GOOGL | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: LOW | REASONING: RSI is overbought (75.3), suggesting a potential short-term pullback. While the AI trend is BULLISH (MEDIUM), adding to an already overbought position is not aligned with capital preservation. Holding the current long position. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 7\n",
      "STOCK: META | ACTION: BUY | PRIORITY: HIGH | REASONING: Current position is a large short (-14 shares), while the AI trend is BULLISH (LOW) and RSI is neutral. Buying 10 shares reduces significant short exposure, prioritizing capital preservation against a potential bullish reversal, even if the AI signal is low confidence. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 8\n",
      "STOCK: AMZN | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: LOW | REASONING: Both RSI (49.7) and AI trend are NEUTRAL (LOW). There are no strong technical signals to warrant a buy or sell action, so holding the current position is prudent. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 5\n",
      "STOCK: NFLX | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: LOW | REASONING: RSI is overbought (75.9), suggesting a potential short-term pullback. While the AI trend is BULLISH (MEDIUM), adding to an already overbought position is not aligned with capital preservation. Holding the current small long position. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 7\n",
      "STOCK: MSFT | ACTION: SELL | PRIORITY: HIGH | REASONING: The AI trend is BEARISH (MEDIUM) and RSI is declining (37.8), signaling further downside. Selling 10 shares helps to close the current long position and align with the bearish trend, prioritizing capital preservation. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 9\n",
      "STOCK: NVDA | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: MEDIUM | REASONING: AI trend is BULLISH (MEDIUM) and RSI is favorable (61.4), suggesting a buy. However, adding 10 shares to the current 9 shares would exceed the maximum allowed position of 15 shares, preventing a buy action. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 7\n",
      "STOCK: TSLA | ACTION: BUY | PRIORITY: MEDIUM | REASONING: AI trend is BULLISH (MEDIUM) and RSI is supportive (65.0), indicating potential for further upside. There is room to add 10 shares, building a stronger position in alignment with strong technical signals. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 8\n",
      "STOCK: CRM | ACTION: BUY | PRIORITY: HIGH | REASONING: Current position is a large short (-14 shares), and RSI is oversold (27.7). While the AI trend is BEARISH (MEDIUM), the oversold RSI suggests a high probability of a short-term bounce. Buying 10 shares reduces significant short exposure to mitigate risk from a potential upward correction. | TECHNICAL_SCORE: 8\n",
      "STOCK: ADBE | ACTION: HOLD | PRIORITY: LOW | REASONING: The AI trend is BEARISH (LOW) and RSI is neutral (40.7).
